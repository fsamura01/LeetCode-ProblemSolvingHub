# **Here’s a breakdown of the constraints for**LeetCode 141: Linked List Cycle:\*\*

1. **`The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 10^4]`**

   - The linked list can have between **0 and 10,000 nodes**.
   - This means an **O(n)** time complexity solution is acceptable, but **O(n²)** would be too slow for large inputs.

2. **`-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`**

   - Each node's value can be between **-100,000 and 100,000**.
   - No special handling is needed for large values since we only need to detect cycles, not perform arithmetic.

3. **`pos is -1 or a valid index in the linked list`**
   - `pos` refers to the index where the cycle begins (if any).
   - If `pos == -1`, there is **no cycle** in the linked list.
   - If `pos >= 0`, the last node of the list connects to the node at that index, forming a cycle.

## 🚀 **What this means for implementation:**

- Since `n` can be large (`10⁴`), we should aim for **O(n) time complexity**.
- We can detect cycles using:
  - **Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare Algorithm (Two-Pointer Approach) → O(n) time, O(1) space** ✅ (Best choice)
  - **Hash Set (Store visited nodes) → O(n) time, O(n) space** ❌ (Less optimal due to extra memory usage)
