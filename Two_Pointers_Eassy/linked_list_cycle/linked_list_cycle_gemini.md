# **Understanding the Problem:**

We're tasked with determining if a given linked list contains a cycle. A cycle exists when a node in the list points back to a previously visited node.

## **Approach: Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (Slow and Fast Pointer)**

- **This algorithm is a classic approach to detect cycles in linked lists. It involves two pointers:**

1. **Slow Pointer:** Moves one node at a time.
2. **Fast Pointer:** Moves two nodes at a time.

- **If there's a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer.**

## **JavaScript Implementation:**

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var hasCycle = function (head) {
  if (!head || !head.next) {
    return false;
  }

  let slow = head;
  let fast = head.next;

  while (slow !== fast) {
    if (!fast || !fast.next) {
      return false;
    }
    slow = slow.next;
    fast = fast.next.next;
  }

  return true;
};
```

## **Explanation:**

1. **Initialization:**

   - We initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the head of the linked list.
   - We check for edge cases where the list is empty or has only one node.

2. **Cycle Detection Loop:**
   - We iterate until `slow` and `fast` pointers meet.
   - In each iteration:
     - `slow` moves one step forward.
     - `fast` moves two steps forward.
   - If the pointers meet, there's a cycle.
   - If `fast` or `fast.next` becomes `null`, there's no cycle.

## **Time and Space Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we use only two pointers.

## **Key Points:**

- The algorithm's efficiency stems from the fact that the fast pointer eventually overtakes the slow pointer in a cycle.
- This approach is widely used for cycle detection in various data structures.

## **Conclusions**

- By following these steps and understanding the underlying logic,  
  you can effectively detect cycles in linked lists using JavaScript.
