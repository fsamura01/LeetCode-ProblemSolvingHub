# **Comprehensive Sort Array By Parity Algorithm Flowchart**

## I'll create a detailed flowchart that breaks down the Sort Array By Parity solution, making sure to capture all the important decision points and processes

I'll create an improved flowchart with clearer decision points and better formatting.

Let me explain why this flowchart effectively represents our array partitioning algorithm:

1. **Initial Decision Point**
   The flowchart begins with a crucial optimization check: if the array has 0 or 1 elements, we can immediately return it since no sorting is needed. This prevents unnecessary processing for trivial cases.

2. **Two-Pointer Setup**
   After passing the initial check, we establish our two pointers. The left pointer starts at the beginning (index 0), searching for odd numbers, while the right pointer starts at the end, searching for even numbers. This setup enables us to partition the array in a single pass.

3. **Main Loop Structure**
   The central control flow revolves around the condition `left < right`. This condition ensures that:

   - We don't process elements unnecessarily once the pointers meet
   - We maintain the integrity of our partitioning process
   - We achieve the O(n) time complexity by processing each element at most once

4. **Three Key Decision Points** (highlighted in light blue):

   - Are the pointers still valid? (`left < right`)
   - Is the left element odd? (`nums[left] % 2 === 1`)
   - Is the right element even? (`nums[right] % 2 === 0`)

   These decisions guide the algorithm's flow and determine when to:

   - Move pointers
   - Perform swaps
   - Complete the processing

5. **Swap Operation** (highlighted in gold):
   The swap operation is emphasized because it's the core mechanism for partitioning the array. It only occurs when we find both:

   - An odd number on the left that needs to move right
   - An even number on the right that needs to move left

6. **Return Points** (highlighted in light blue):
   There are two exit points from the algorithm:
   - Early return for arrays of length â‰¤ 1
   - Normal return after completing the partitioning

This flowchart helps visualize how the algorithm maintains its key invariant: all even numbers will end up before all odd numbers. Every path through the flowchart either:

- Moves a pointer to find the next number to swap
- Performs a swap to move numbers to their correct side
- Returns the correctly partitioned array

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the flowchart in more detail or discuss how certain paths through the flowchart handle specific example cases?
