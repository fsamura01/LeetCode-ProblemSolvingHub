# **Let's break down the constraints for better understanding:**

1. **`nums1.length == m + n`**

   - `nums1` has a total length of `m + n`.
   - The first `m` elements contain actual values, and the last `n` elements are reserved as extra space (usually filled with zeros or placeholders) to merge elements from `nums2`.

2. **`nums2.length == n`**

   - `nums2` has exactly `n` elements, which need to be merged into `nums1`.

3. **`0 <= m, n <= 200`**

   - `m` (number of initialized elements in `nums1`) and `n` (number of elements in `nums2`) can be between `0` and `200`.
   - `m` or `n` can be `0`, meaning one of the arrays might be empty.

4. **`1 <= m + n <= 200`**

   - The total number of valid elements after merging must be at least `1` and at most `200`.
   - This ensures that `nums1` will always have space for all elements from `nums2`.

5. **`-10^9 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 10^9`**
   - The values inside both arrays range between `-1,000,000,000` and `1,000,000,000`.
   - This means we need to handle potentially large integer values.
