# Count the Number of Incremovable Subarrays I

I'll guide you through solving this LeetCode problem while emphasizing problem-solving patterns and strategies.

## 1. Problem Understanding

Let's first understand what the problem is asking:

The problem "Count the Number of Incremovable Subarrays I" asks us to find subarrays that, when removed from the original array, leave behind a strictly increasing sequence.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array. For example, in [1,2,3,4], the subarrays include [1], [2], [3], [4], [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,2,3], [2,3,4], and [1,2,3,4].

An "incremovable" subarray is one that, when removed from the original array, results in the remaining elements forming a strictly increasing sequence (each element is greater than the previous one).

For example, if we have [1,2,3,10,4,5,6], and we remove the subarray [10], we get [1,2,3,4,5,6], which is a strictly increasing sequence. So [10] is an incremovable subarray.

Our task is to count how many such incremovable subarrays exist in the given array.

## 2. Pattern Identification

This problem involves:

- Testing different subarrays to see if removing them creates a strictly increasing sequence
- Checking if a sequence is strictly increasing

This is fundamentally an array processing problem. We'll need to:

1. Generate all possible subarrays
2. For each subarray, check if removing it results in a strictly increasing sequence

The pattern here is a combination of:

- Enumeration (generating all possible subarrays)
- Validation (checking if a sequence is strictly increasing)

## 3. Approach Discussion

Let's develop a step-by-step approach:

1. Define a function to check if an array is strictly increasing.
2. Generate all possible subarrays of the input array.
3. For each subarray:
   - Remove it from the original array.
   - Check if the remaining elements form a strictly increasing sequence.
   - If yes, count it as an incremovable subarray.
4. Return the count of incremovable subarrays.

The key insight is that we need to systematically test each possible subarray by temporarily removing it and checking the property of the remaining elements.

## 4. Code Implementation

Let's implement this solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
function incremovableSubarrayCount(nums) {
    // Helper function to check if an array is strictly increasing
    function isStrictlyIncreasing(arr) {
        for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] <= arr[i-1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    let count = 0;
    const n = nums.length;
    
    // Generate all possible subarrays and check each one
    for (let start = 0; start < n; start++) {
        for (let end = start; end < n; end++) {
            // Create the remaining array after removing the subarray [start...end]
            const remaining = [];
            
            // Add elements before the removed subarray
            for (let i = 0; i < start; i++) {
                remaining.push(nums[i]);
            }
            
            // Add elements after the removed subarray
            for (let i = end + 1; i < n; i++) {
                remaining.push(nums[i]);
            }
            
            // Check if the remaining array is strictly increasing
            if (isStrictlyIncreasing(remaining)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

In this implementation:

- The `isStrictlyIncreasing` helper function checks if a given array has elements in strictly increasing order.
- We use two nested loops to generate all possible subarrays by their start and end indices.
- For each subarray, we create a new array (`remaining`) containing all elements except those in the subarray.
- We then check if this remaining array is strictly increasing and increment our counter if it is.

## 5. Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:**

- Generating all possible subarrays: O(n²) where n is the length of the input array.
- For each subarray, creating the remaining array and checking if it's strictly increasing: O(n)
- Overall time complexity: O(n³)

**Space Complexity:**

- We create a new array (`remaining`) for each subarray: O(n)
- Overall space complexity: O(n)

## 6. Alternative Solutions

We can optimize our solution by avoiding the creation of a new array for each subarray check:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
function incremovableSubarrayCount(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    let count = 0;
    
    for (let start = 0; start < n; start++) {
        for (let end = start; end < n; end++) {
            // Check if the array without the subarray [start...end] is strictly increasing
            let isValid = true;
            let prev = -Infinity; // Initialize with negative infinity
            
            // Check elements before the removed subarray
            for (let i = 0; i < start; i++) {
                if (nums[i] <= prev) {
                    isValid = false;
                    break;
                }
                prev = nums[i];
            }
            
            // Check elements after the removed subarray
            if (isValid) {
                for (let i = end + 1; i < n; i++) {
                    if (nums[i] <= prev) {
                        isValid = false;
                        break;
                    }
                    prev = nums[i];
                }
            }
            
            if (isValid) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

This optimized version:

- Avoids creating a new array for each subarray check
- Checks the strictly increasing property on-the-fly
- Maintains the same time complexity, but reduces the constant factor
- Improves space complexity to O(1)

## 7. Practice Recommendations

Here are similar LeetCode problems to practice this pattern:

1. "Maximum Subarray" (LeetCode #53) - Similar subarray enumeration
2. "Subarray Sum Equals K" (LeetCode #560) - Working with subarrays
3. "Longest Increasing Subsequence" (LeetCode #300) - Understanding increasing sequences
4. "Count Number of Nice Subarrays" (LeetCode #1248) - Counting subarrays with a property
5. "Number of Subarrays with Bounded Maximum" (LeetCode #795) - Counting subarrays with a condition

## 8. Flowchart Design

Here's a flowchart illustrating the solution:

This flowchart visualizes:

1. The main algorithm that iterates through all possible subarrays
2. The validation process to check if removing a subarray results in a strictly increasing sequence
3. The decision points that determine whether to count a subarray as "incremovable"

## Key Insights and Takeaways

1. **Problem Analysis**: Breaking down the problem into simpler components (subarray generation + validation) makes it more tractable.

2. **Brute Force Enumeration**: Sometimes a direct approach of generating all possibilities and checking each one is a valid strategy, especially for smaller input sizes.

3. **Short-Circuit Evaluation**: In our optimized solution, we stop checking as soon as we find a violation of the strictly increasing property, which can save computation time.

4. **In-Place Checking**: We can avoid creating new arrays by cleverly tracking the previous element and checking the property in-place.

5. **Edge Cases**: We carefully handle the boundary between elements before and after the removed subarray.

The core of this problem lies in systematically exploring all possible subarrays and efficiently checking a property of the remaining elements. This pattern of "try all possibilities and check a condition" is common in array problems and technical interviews.
