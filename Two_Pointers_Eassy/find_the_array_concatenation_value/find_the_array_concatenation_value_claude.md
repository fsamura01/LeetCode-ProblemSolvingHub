# LeetCode 2562: Find the Array Concatenation Value

## 1. Problem Understanding

Let me explain this problem in simple terms:

You're given an array of integers `nums`. The "concatenation value" is calculated by taking the first and last numbers, concatenating them as strings (placing them side by side), and converting the result back to an integer. After that, you remove these two numbers and repeat the process with the remaining array until no numbers are left. If only one number remains at the end, its value is simply added to the result.

For example, if we have `[7, 52, 2, 4]`:

- Concatenate 7 and 4: "74" = 74
- Remove 7 and 4, leaving [52, 2]
- Concatenate 52 and 2: "522" = 522
- Total concatenation value = 74 + 522 = 596

**Constraints:**

- The array length is between 1 and 1000
- Each number is between 1 and 10^4

## **2. Pattern Identification**

This problem uses the **two-pointer technique**. We need to process elements from both ends of the array simultaneously, which is a classic use case for two pointers.

We'll maintain a left pointer starting at the beginning of the array and a right pointer starting at the end. We'll move these pointers toward each other, processing the values as we go.

## **3. Approach Discussion**

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a variable `result` to store the total concatenation value, starting at 0.
2. Initialize two pointers: `left` at index 0 and `right` at the last index (length - 1).
3. While `left` is less than or equal to `right`:
   - If `left` equals `right` (one element remains):
     - Add that element to `result` and break the loop.
   - Otherwise:
     - Concatenate the values at `left` and `right` as strings.
     - Convert the concatenated string back to an integer.
     - Add this integer to `result`.
   - Increment `left` and decrement `right` to move the pointers inward.
4. Return the final `result`.

This approach handles both odd and even-length arrays correctly.

## **4. Code Implementation**

Let's implement this solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
function findTheArrayConcVal(nums) {
    let result = 0;
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        // If there's only one element left (odd-length array)
        if (left === right) {
            result += nums[left];
            break;
        }
        
        // Concatenate the numbers as strings, then convert back to number
        const concatenated = parseInt(nums[left].toString() + nums[right].toString());
        result += concatenated;
        
        // Move pointers inward
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## **5. Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input array. We process each element exactly once, and string concatenation and conversion operations are O(1) for the small integers in this problem.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few variables regardless of the input size. We don't create any data structures that scale with the input.

## **6. Alternative Solutions**

An alternative approach could use a loop with an index counter:

```javascript
function findTheArrayConcVal(nums) {
    let result = 0;
    const n = nums.length;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
        // Check if we're at the middle element of an odd-length array
        if (i === n - 1 - i) {
            result += nums[i];
        } else {
            result += parseInt(nums[i].toString() + nums[n - 1 - i].toString());
        }
    }
    
    // Handle the middle element if the array length is odd
    if (n % 2 === 1) {
        result += nums[Math.floor(n / 2)];
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

However, this approach is a bit more complex and prone to off-by-one errors. The two-pointer method is cleaner and more intuitive.

## **8. Flowchart Design**

## **Summary**

The problem "Find the Array Concatenation Value" is a straightforward application of the two-pointer technique. We process elements from both ends of the array, concatenating them as strings and converting back to integers. This approach efficiently handles both odd and even-length arrays.

1. Recognizing when to use the two-pointer technique
2. Understanding how to convert between strings and numbers in JavaScript
3. Handling the special case of a single remaining element

This problem is a good example of how a seemingly complex operation can be broken down into a simple algorithmic pattern. The two-pointer technique is a versatile tool that appears in many interview problems, so understanding it well will serve you in solving many other algorithmic challenges.

Remember that when approaching similar problems, identifying the correct pattern is often the most crucial step. For this problem, the two-pointer technique provides an elegant and efficient solution with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity.

I'll create a comprehensive flowchart using Mermaid that illustrates the solution for finding the array concatenation value. The flowchart will visualize all the key steps in the algorithm:

## Understanding the Flowchart

Let me explain the key components of this Mermaid flowchart that illustrates the array concatenation value algorithm:

### Phases of the Algorithm

1. **Initialization Phase**:
   - We start by initializing our result variable to 0
   - We set up two pointers: left at the beginning (index 0) and right at the end (index length-1)

2. **Main Processing Loop**:
   - The core loop continues as long as left ≤ right (meaning we still have elements to process)
   - For each iteration, we check if we're down to a single element (left === right)
   - If it's a single element, we simply add its value to the result and break the loop
   - If we have two elements, we concatenate them as strings, convert back to integer, and add to result
   - We then move our pointers inward (left++ and right--)

3. **Return Phase**:
   - Once our pointers cross (left > right), we return the final result

### Decision Points

The flowchart highlights two critical decision points:

- Whether we should continue processing elements (left ≤ right?)
- Whether we're dealing with a single remaining element (left === right?)

### Example Execution

I've included a step-by-step example execution using the array [7, 52, 2, 4]:

1. First iteration: Concatenate '7' and '4' = 74, add to result (result = 74)
2. Second iteration: Concatenate '52' and '2' = 522, add to result (result = 596)
3. Final result: 596

### Visual Differentiation

The flowchart uses different colors and styles to distinguish between:

- Process steps (blue boxes)
- Decision points (red diamonds)
- Start/end terminals (green rounded rectangles)
- Example annotations (yellow notes)

This comprehensive visualization captures the entire algorithm workflow, making it easier to understand the solution's logical progression and how the two-pointer technique is applied to solve this specific problem.
