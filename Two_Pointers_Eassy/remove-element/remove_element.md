# The two constraints belong to different problems, \*\*"Remove Duplicates from Sorted

<!--Array"** and **"Remove Element"\*\*, and they have distinct constraints and requirements. Let‚Äôs compare them:-->

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Constraints: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**

```javascript
1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10‚Å¥
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
```

### **Key Differences:**

- ‚úÖ **Larger Input Size**:
  - The array size is **much larger** (`1 ‚â§ nums.length ‚â§ 30,000`).
  - Efficient **O(n)** solutions are required to handle large cases.
- ‚úÖ **Sorted Array Property**:

  - The array is already **sorted in non-decreasing order**.
  - This means **all duplicate elements are adjacent**.

- ‚úÖ **Element Range**:
  - Elements range from **-100 to 100** (can be negative).

### **What This Means for the Solution:**

- Since duplicates are **always adjacent**, a **two-pointer technique** is optimal.
- The problem asks to **remove duplicates in-place**, maintaining order.

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Constraints: Remove Element**

```javascript
0 <= nums.length <= 100;
0 <= nums[i] <= 50;
0 <= val <= 100;
```

### **Key Differences: (Remove Element)**

- ‚úÖ **Smaller Input Size**:

  - The array size is **much smaller** (`0 ‚â§ nums.length ‚â§ 100`).
  - **Brute-force O(n¬≤) approaches can still work**, but an **O(n) solution** is ideal.

- ‚úÖ **Unsorted Array**:

  - The array is **not necessarily sorted**.
  - The target value (`val`) can be anywhere in the array.

- ‚úÖ **Element & Target Range**:
  - Numbers are **non-negative** (`0 ‚â§ nums[i] ‚â§ 50`).
  - The element to be removed (`val`) can be **between 0 and 100**.

### **What This Means for the Solution:(Remove Element)**

- Since the array is **not sorted**, you cannot rely on adjacency.
- The problem requires removing **a specific value** (`val`), not duplicates.
- A **two-pointer approach** or **in-place shifting** is often used.

## **Summary of Differences**

| Constraint               | **Remove Duplicates**                       | **Remove Element**                     |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Array Size**           | `1 ‚â§ nums.length ‚â§ 30,000` (Large)          | `0 ‚â§ nums.length ‚â§ 100` (Small)        |
| **Sorting**              | ‚úÖ Sorted                                   | ‚ùå Unsorted                            |
| **Element Range**        | `-100 ‚â§ nums[i] ‚â§ 100` (Includes negatives) | `0 ‚â§ nums[i] ‚â§ 50` (Only non-negative) |
| **Target Value (`val`)** | ‚ùå Not specified                            | `0 ‚â§ val ‚â§ 100`                        |
| **Goal**                 | Remove **adjacent** duplicates              | Remove **specific** element            |

## **Which Algorithms Work Best?**

- **For "Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array"**:

  - **Two-pointer technique** (fast & slow pointers) ‚úÖ **O(n)**
  - **In-place modification** since array is sorted.

- **For "Remove Element"**:
  - **Two-pointer technique** or **swap method** ‚úÖ **O(n)**
  - **No sorting guarantee**, so linear scan is necessary.
