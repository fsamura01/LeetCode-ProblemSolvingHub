# <!--Here’s a breakdown of the given constraints:-->

1. **`1 <= s.length <= 2 * 10^5`**

   - The string `s` has at least **1** character and at most **200,000** characters.
   - This means any solution should be optimized for **efficiency**, preferably **O(n)** time complexity, since an **O(n²)** solution may be too slow for large inputs.

2. **`125. Valid Palindrome consists only of printable ASCII characters`**
   - The input string contains only **printable ASCII characters** (i.e., characters in the range 32-126 in ASCII).
   - These include letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), punctuation (`!@#$%^&*()`), and spaces.
