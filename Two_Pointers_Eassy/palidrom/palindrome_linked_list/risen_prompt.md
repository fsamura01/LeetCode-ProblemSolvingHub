## **Leetcode Problem 234: Palindrome Linked List**

---

### **R - Role**

You are a **Python developer preparing for coding interviews**. You need to solve Leetcode Problem 234 efficiently.

### **I - Instruction**

Write a Python function to determine if a **singly linked list** is a **palindrome**. The function should have an **optimal time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1)**.

### **S - Steps**

1. Use the **fast and slow pointer technique** to find the middle of the linked list.
2. Reverse the second half of the list **in place**.
3. Compare the first half with the reversed second half to check for a palindrome.
4. Restore the original list structure (optional).
5. Return `True` if the list is a palindrome, otherwise `False`.

### **E - End Goal**

The function should:  
âœ… Handle edge cases like an **empty list** or a **single node**.  
âœ… Use **O(n) time complexity** and **O(1) extra space**.  
âœ… Work correctly for both **even and odd-length lists**.

### **N - Narrowing**

- Assume the input is a **singly linked list** where each node contains an integer value.
- You **cannot** modify the values in the list; only the structure can be changed temporarily.
- The solution should be implemented in **Python**.

### **Final Prompt:**

_"Write a Javascript function to check if a singly linked list is a palindrome. Use an optimal approach with O(n) time and O(1) space complexity. Implement the fast and slow pointer technique to find the middle of the list, reverse the second half in place, and compare it with the first half. Ensure the function handles edge cases like an empty list or a single node. Restore the list structure if modified. Return `True` if the list is a palindrome, otherwise `False`."_
