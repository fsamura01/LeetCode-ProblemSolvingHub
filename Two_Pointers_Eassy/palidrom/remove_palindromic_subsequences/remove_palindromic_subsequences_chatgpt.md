# **1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences**

## 🚀 Problem-Solving Guide for "1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences"

---

## **1️⃣ Problem Understanding**

**Problem Statement:**  
Given a string `s` consisting only of characters `'a'` and `'b'`, we need to remove its characters by deleting **palindromic subsequences** until the string is empty. Our goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required.

**Key Observations:**

- A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived by deleting characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
- A **palindrome** is a sequence that reads the same forward and backward.

**Constraints:**

- \(1 \leq s.length \leq 1000\)
- \(s\) consists only of `'a'` and `'b'`.

**Edge Cases to Consider:**  
✅ If `s` is already empty → return `0`.  
✅ If `s` itself is a palindrome → return `1` (since the entire string can be removed in one step).  
✅ Otherwise, return `2` (since we can remove all `'a'` in one step and all `'b'` in another).

---

## **2️⃣ Pattern Identification**

- **Greedy Strategy**: The problem can be solved optimally without needing advanced techniques like dynamic programming.
- **String Manipulation**: Since we are only dealing with two unique characters, removing all of one type in one operation is optimal.

---

## **3️⃣ Approach Discussion**

### **Intuition**

1. **Check if the string is already empty** → If yes, return `0`.
2. **Check if the string is a palindrome** → If yes, return `1` (since we can remove it in one step).
3. **Otherwise**, the worst case is that we remove all `'a'`s in one step and all `'b'`s in another → return `2`.

---

## **4️⃣ Code Implementation (JavaScript)**

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var removePalindromeSub = function (s) {
  // Step 1: Check if the string is empty
  if (s.length === 0) return 0;

  // Step 2: Check if the string is a palindrome
  const isPalindrome = (str) => {
    let left = 0,
      right = str.length - 1;
    while (left < right) {
      if (str[left] !== str[right]) return false;
      left++;
      right--;
    }
    return true;
  };

  if (isPalindrome(s)) return 1;

  // Step 3: If not a palindrome, return 2
  return 2;
};
```

✅ **Key Comments:**

- **`isPalindrome()`** function checks if `s` is a palindrome using two pointers.
- If `s` is already a palindrome, we remove it in **one step**.
- If not, we remove all occurrences of `'a'` in one step and `'b'` in another, taking **two steps**.

## **5️⃣ Complexity Analysis**

- **Checking if a string is empty** → \(O(1)\)
- **Checking if a string is a palindrome** → \(O(n)\), where `n` is the length of `s`
- **Final decision step** → \(O(1)\)

### **Overall Complexity: \(O(n)\)**

- Space Complexity: \(O(1)\) since we use only a few extra variables.

## **6️⃣ Alternative Approaches & Optimizations**

Since our solution already runs in **O(n) time**, it is optimal. However:

- If the problem had **more than two unique characters**, we would need a more complex approach (e.g., dynamic programming).
- If `s` contained a mix of characters, a **frequency-based approach** might be needed.
