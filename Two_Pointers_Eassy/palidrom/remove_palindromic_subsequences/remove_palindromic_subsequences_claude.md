# **1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences**

Let me guide you through solving the "Remove Palindromic Subsequences" problem with a focus on understanding the core concepts and problem-solving strategies.

Let's begin by breaking down each aspect:

1. Problem Understanding:
   The problem gives us a binary string (containing only 'a' and 'b' characters) and asks us to find the minimum number of steps needed to make the string empty. In each step, we can remove any palindromic subsequence from the string.

Key constraints:

- String contains only 'a' and 'b' characters
- 1 ≤ s.length ≤ 1000
- The string is non-empty

Let's think about what makes this problem interesting. A subsequence doesn't need to be contiguous - we can skip characters while maintaining their relative order. This is a crucial insight that will help us solve the problem.

## Pattern Identification

This problem appears to be about string manipulation and palindromes, but it has a clever twist. Instead of immediately jumping to complex algorithms, let's think about the properties of our input:

- We only have two characters ('a' and 'b')
- We can remove any palindromic subsequence
- We want the minimum number of steps

## Approach Discussion

Let's think through this systematically:

First, what's special about having only two characters?

- All 'a's form a palindromic subsequence
- All 'b's form a palindromic subsequence

This leads us to a key insight: we can always solve this in at most 2 steps!

Here's why:

1. If the string is already a palindrome → 1 step
2. If not → we can remove all 'a's in one step, then all 'b's in another step → 2 steps
3. If empty → 0 steps

Let me implement this solution:

Let's analyze the complexities:

Time Complexity: O(n)

- We only need to check if the string is a palindrome once
- The palindrome check takes O(n) time where n is the length of the string

Space Complexity: O(1)

- We only use two pointers for the palindrome check
- No additional space is required that grows with input size

Now, let's create a flowchart to visualize the decision process:

This problem teaches us several important lessons:

1. Sometimes, what appears to be a complex problem has a simple solution when we identify the right properties
2. The constraints of the problem (only 'a' and 'b') are crucial to finding the optimal solution
3. Understanding subsequences vs. substrings is important for string manipulation problems

For additional practice, I recommend these similar problems:

1. LeetCode 516: "Longest Palindromic Subsequence"
2. LeetCode 647: "Palindromic Substrings"
3. LeetCode 1328: "Break a Palindrome"

These problems will help you strengthen your understanding of palindromes and string manipulation techniques.

Would you like me to explain any particular aspect of the solution in more detail?

Let me help you understand the crucial distinction between subsequences and substrings, as this difference often plays a key role in solving string manipulation problems.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. Think of it like taking a slice of the original string where all characters must be connected. For example, in the word "CODING":

- "COD" is a substring
- "ING" is a substring
- "CDG" is not a substring because the characters aren't contiguous

A subsequence, on the other hand, is a sequence that can be derived from the original string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. It's like being able to "skip" characters while maintaining their relative positions. In "CODING":

- "CDG" is a subsequence (we kept C, D, and G while skipping O, I, N)
- "CIN" is a subsequence
- "CODING" is also a subsequence (when we keep all characters)

Let's see this difference in action with a practical example:

This distinction is particularly important in our original "Remove Palindromic Subsequences" problem. If we were working with substrings instead of subsequences, the solution would be much more complex because:

1. We would need to find all possible palindromic substrings
2. We would need to determine the optimal order to remove them
3. Some palindromic substrings might overlap, complicating our choices

However, because we're working with subsequences:

1. We can select any characters we want (maintaining their order)
2. All 'a's form a palindromic subsequence regardless of position
3. All 'b's form a palindromic subsequence regardless of position

Let's visualize this with another example:

The impact of this distinction on problem-solving strategies is significant:

1. **Substring Problems**:

   - Often use sliding window technique
   - Require checking contiguous elements
   - Usually have O(n²) solutions for generating all substrings
   - Common in problems like "Longest Palindromic Substring"

2. **Subsequence Problems**:
   - Often use dynamic programming
   - Allow skipping elements
   - Can have 2ⁿ possible subsequences
   - Common in problems like "Longest Common Subsequence"

When you encounter a string manipulation problem, asking yourself "Am I working with substrings or subsequences?" can help guide you to the appropriate algorithm and data structure choices. This distinction is particularly important because:

1. It affects the solution's time complexity
2. It determines which algorithms are applicable
3. It influences how we think about the problem space
4. It can dramatically simplify or complicate the solution

Would you like me to provide more examples of problems where this distinction plays a crucial role, or shall we explore any specific aspect of this concept in more detail?
