# Let me help you analyze this solution for the "Move Zeroes" problem, where we need to move all zeros to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements

The current solution has a few issues that would make it not work correctly for this problem. Let's understand why:

1. The main issue is that this approach uses a two-pointer technique from both ends, which will not preserve the relative order of non-zero elements. The problem requires that we keep the original order of non-zero numbers.

2. Let's see what happens with an example array [0,1,0,3,12]:
   - Initially: left = 0, right = 4
   - First swap would be between 0 and 12
   - This would change the relative ordering of non-zero elements

Here's the correct solution that maintains the relative order:

```javascript
var moveZeroes = function (nums) {
  // Keep track of where we should place the next non-zero number
  let nonZeroIndex = 0;

  // First pass: move all non-zero elements to the front
  for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (nums[i] !== 0) {
      // Swap current non-zero element with position at nonZeroIndex
      [nums[nonZeroIndex], nums[i]] = [nums[i], nums[nonZeroIndex]];
      nonZeroIndex++;
    }
  }
};
```

Let's understand how this works:

1. We use a `nonZeroIndex` pointer that keeps track of where the next non-zero number should go.

2. As we iterate through the array:

   - When we find a non-zero number, we swap it with the position at `nonZeroIndex`
   - Then we increment `nonZeroIndex` to prepare for the next non-zero number

3. Example with [0,1,0,3,12]:
   - First iteration (i=0): number is 0, skip
   - Second iteration (i=1): find 1, swap with position 0 → [1,0,0,3,12]
   - Third iteration (i=2): number is 0, skip
   - Fourth iteration (i=3): find 3, swap with position 1 → [1,3,0,0,12]
   - Fifth iteration (i=4): find 12, swap with position 2 → [1,3,12,0,0]

This solution has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), which is optimal. Would you like me to explain any part of this solution in more detail?

I'll create a flowchart to visualize how the solution works using Mermaid.

Let me explain the flowchart:

1. The main algorithm flow is shown in the top section:

   - We start by initializing `nonZeroIndex` to 0
   - We then enter the main loop that continues while `i` is less than the array length
   - For each element, we check if it's non-zero
   - If it is non-zero, we swap it with the position at `nonZeroIndex` and increment `nonZeroIndex`
   - Either way, we increment `i` and continue the loop

2. The bottom section shows an example execution with the array [0,1,0,3,12]:
   - We can see how the array transforms step by step
   - Each step shows the current state of the array and the values of our pointers
   - This helps visualize how the non-zero elements gradually move to their correct positions while maintaining their relative order

The flowchart illustrates how we only perform swaps when we encounter non-zero elements, and how the `nonZeroIndex` pointer helps us maintain the proper positioning of elements. Would you like me to explain any particular part of the flowchart in more detail?
