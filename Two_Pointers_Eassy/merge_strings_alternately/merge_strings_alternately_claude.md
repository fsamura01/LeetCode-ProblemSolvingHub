# **1768. Merge Strings Alternately**

Let me guide you through solving the "Merge Strings Alternately" problem using a structured approach that will help build your problem-solving skills.

## **Problem Understanding:**

Let's first break down what this problem is asking us to do. We're given two strings, word1 and word2, and we need to merge them by alternating their characters, starting with word1. If one string is longer than the other, the remaining letters should be appended at the end of the merged string.

```javascript
For example:
- Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
- Output: "apbqcr"
```

```javascript
Key constraints:
- 1 ≤ word1.length, word2.length ≤ 100
- Both strings consist of lowercase English letters
```

## **Pattern Identification:**

This problem follows the "Two Pointers" pattern, which is commonly used when we need to:

- Process two sequences simultaneously
- Compare or combine elements from two different arrays/strings
- Track positions in multiple sequences

The two-pointer pattern is especially useful here because we need to alternate between the two strings while keeping track of our position in each one.

## **Step-by-Step Approach:**

Let me create a flowchart to visualize our approach:

## **Code Implementation:**

Let's write the solution with detailed comments explaining each step:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} word1
 * @param {string} word2
 * @return {string}
 */
function mergeAlternately(word1, word2) {
  // Initialize result string and pointers for both words
  let result = "";
  let i = 0,
    j = 0;

  // Continue while either string has characters left
  while (i < word1.length || j < word2.length) {
    // If word1 has characters remaining, add the next one
    if (i < word1.length) {
      result += word1[i];
      i++;
    }

    // If word2 has characters remaining, add the next one
    if (j < word2.length) {
      result += word2[j];
      j++;
    }
  }

  return result;
}
```

## **Complexity Analysis:**

- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the longer string
  - We make a single pass through both strings
  - Each character is processed exactly once
- Space Complexity: O(n)
  - We create a new string to store the result
  - The space needed is proportional to the sum of the lengths of both input strings

## **Alternative Solutions:**

We could also solve this using a more concise approach with array methods:

```javascript
function mergeAlternately(word1, word2) {
  const maxLength = Math.max(word1.length, word2.length);
  return Array.from(
    { length: maxLength },
    (_, i) => (word1[i] || "") + (word2[i] || "")
  ).join("");
}
```

This solution is more elegant but might be slightly less efficient due to array creation and joining.

## **Similar Problems for Practice:**

Here are some related problems that use similar patterns:

- LeetCode 88: "Merge Sorted Array"
- LeetCode 21: "Merge Two Sorted Lists"
- LeetCode 977: "Squares of a Sorted Array"

These problems all involve processing two sequences simultaneously and are good practice for the two-pointer pattern.

## **Key Learning Points:**

1. The two-pointer technique is powerful for problems involving two sequences
2. When merging sequences, always consider what happens when they have different lengths
3. String concatenation in a loop is a common pattern for building result strings
4. Edge cases often involve empty strings or strings of different lengths

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or would you like to try solving one of the practice problems I suggested?
