## **Code Block Explanation**

```javascript
} else if (nums1[i] < nums2[j]) {
    i++;
} else {
    j++;
}
```

---

## **Context**

This code appears within a `while` loop where two pointers, `i` and `j`, traverse two sorted arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`. The main goal is to compare elements in the two arrays to find matches.

---

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**

#### **1. Compare Elements at the Current Pointers**

- At each iteration, the loop compares the elements at the current indices (`nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]`):

  ```javascript
  if (nums1[i] === nums2[j]) {
    result.push(nums1[i]); // Match found, add to the result.
    i++; // Move both pointers forward.
    j++;
  }
  ```

- If `nums1[i] === nums2[j]`, it means the current elements are the same, so the element is added to the result, and both pointers are incremented to move to the next element in each array.

---

#### **2. Handle the Case When `nums1[i] < nums2[j]`**

```javascript
else if (nums1[i] < nums2[j]) {
    i++; // Increment pointer `i` to check the next element in nums1.
}
```

- If `nums1[i] < nums2[j]`, it means the element in `nums1` is smaller than the one in `nums2`.
- Since the arrays are sorted, this means:
  - The current element of `nums1` can never match any future elements of `nums2` (because all remaining elements in `nums2` are greater or equal to `nums2[j]`).
  - Therefore, increment the pointer `i` to move to the next element in `nums1`.

---

#### **3. Handle the Case When `nums1[i] > nums2[j]`**

```javascript
else {
    j++; // Increment pointer `j` to check the next element in nums2.
}
```

- If `nums1[i] > nums2[j]`, it means the element in `nums2` is smaller than the one in `nums1`.
- Similar to the previous case, this implies:
  - The current element of `nums2` can never match any future elements of `nums1` (because all remaining elements in `nums1` are greater or equal to `nums1[i]`).
  - Therefore, increment the pointer `j` to move to the next element in `nums2`.

---

### **Summary**

- The condition `else if (nums1[i] < nums2[j])` checks which pointer needs to advance to potentially find a match.
  - If `nums1[i]` is smaller, increment `i`.
  - If `nums2[j]` is smaller, increment `j`.
- By doing this, both pointers efficiently skip over irrelevant elements in the sorted arrays.

---

### **Example Walkthrough**

#### **Arrays:**

```javascript
nums1 = [1, 2, 4];
nums2 = [2, 3, 4];
```

#### **Steps:**

1. **Initial Pointers**: `i = 0`, `j = 0`

   - Compare `nums1[0] = 1` and `nums2[0] = 2`.
   - `nums1[0] < nums2[0]` → Increment `i` to `1`.

2. **Pointers**: `i = 1`, `j = 0`

   - Compare `nums1[1] = 2` and `nums2[0] = 2`.
   - `nums1[1] === nums2[0]` → Add `2` to the result and increment both pointers: `i = 2`, `j = 1`.

3. **Pointers**: `i = 2`, `j = 1`

   - Compare `nums1[2] = 4` and `nums2[1] = 3`.
   - `nums1[2] > nums2[1]` → Increment `j` to `2`.

4. **Pointers**: `i = 2`, `j = 2`

   - Compare `nums1[2] = 4` and `nums2[2] = 4`.
   - `nums1[2] === nums2[2]` → Add `4` to the result and increment both pointers: `i = 3`, `j = 3`.

5. **End Condition**: `i = 3`, `j = 3`
   - One pointer reaches the end of its array → Exit the loop.

**Final Result**: `[2, 4]`

### **Efficiency of Two-Pointer Logic**

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n_1 + n_2)\), where \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) are the lengths
  of `nums1` and `nums2`. Each pointer moves at most once through its array.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) additional space (apart from the result array).
