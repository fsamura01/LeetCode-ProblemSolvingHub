# Explanation of Valid Substrings in Binary Strings

Great question! Let's break it down logically.

## **Why do valid substrings always occur between consecutive groups of `0`s and `1`s?**

A valid substring must have:

1. **Equal numbers of `0`s and `1`s**.
2. **All `0`s together and all `1`s together**.

Now, let's analyze why valid substrings are always found between **consecutive** groups of `0`s and `1`s.

### **Step 1: Looking at Consecutive Groups**

Consider the string `"00110011"`:

- We can group it into **consecutive segments**:

  ```javascript
  "00" -> (count: 2)
  "11" -> (count: 2)
  "00" -> (count: 2)
  "11" -> (count: 2)
  ```

Each segment contains only **one type of character** (all `0`s or all `1`s).

#### **Step 2: Where Can We Form Valid Substrings?**

- A valid substring must contain **equal** numbers of `0`s and `1`s.
- This means a valid substring can only **start at the boundary between a `0` group and a `1` group**.
- If we pick any other location, the numbers wonâ€™t be equal.

For example:

- `"00"` (invalid, only `0`s)
- `"11"` (invalid, only `1`s)
- `"0011"` (valid, equal numbers of `0`s and `1`s)

#### **Step 3: Counting Valid Substrings**

- We can take the **minimum count** of two adjacent groups to determine how many substrings can be formed.
- Example:

  ```javascript
  "00" (count: 2)
  "11" (count: 2) â†’ min(2,2) = 2 valid substrings: "0011", "01"
  ```

---

### **Conclusion**

Valid substrings **must** occur between consecutive groups of `0`s and `1`s because:

1. They need **equal** numbers of `0`s and `1`s.
2. The only way to achieve that **while keeping `0`s and `1`s grouped together** is by selecting two adjacent groups.

This is why we **count adjacent groups** and take the **minimum** of their sizes to determine the number of valid substrings.

### **Clarification: Minimum Adjacent Group Size**

The **"minimum adjacent group size"** refers to the **smaller count** between two consecutive groups of `0`s and `1`s.

#### **Why is this important?**

A valid binary substring must contain **equal** numbers of `0`s and `1`s, **with all 0s together and all 1s together**.

- Since we have consecutive groups of `0`s and `1`s, the **smallest** of these two group sizes determines how many valid substrings we can form.

---

### **Example 1: "00110011"**

We break it into consecutive groups:

```javascript
"00" â†’ Count = 2
"11" â†’ Count = 2
"00" â†’ Count = 2
"11" â†’ Count = 2
```

Now, we compare adjacent groups and take the **minimum size**:

| Adjacent Groups       | Minimum Count | Valid Substrings |
| --------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| "00" (2) and "11" (2) | min(2,2) = 2  | "0011", "01"     |
| "11" (2) and "00" (2) | min(2,2) = 2  | "1100", "10"     |
| "00" (2) and "11" (2) | min(2,2) = 2  | "0011", "01"     |

**Total valid substrings** = `2 + 2 + 2 = 6`.

---

### **Example 2: "10101"**

We break it into consecutive groups:

```javascript
"1" â†’ Count = 1
"0" â†’ Count = 1
"1" â†’ Count = 1
"0" â†’ Count = 1
"1" â†’ Count = 1
```

| Adjacent Groups     | Minimum Count | Valid Substrings |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| "1" (1) and "0" (1) | min(1,1) = 1  | "10"             |
| "0" (1) and "1" (1) | min(1,1) = 1  | "01"             |
| "1" (1) and "0" (1) | min(1,1) = 1  | "10"             |
| "0" (1) and "1" (1) | min(1,1) = 1  | "01"             |

**Total valid substrings** = `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4`.

---

### **Key Takeaway**

- We **count consecutive `0`s and `1`s**.
- We **compare adjacent group sizes**.
- The number of valid substrings between two adjacent groups is always **`min(previous group size, current group size)`**.

This ensures that we always count **only the possible valid substrings** without including invalid ones.

Great question! The reason we start with `count = 1` instead of `count = 0` is to **account for the first character of the string immediately**. Let's break it down.

---

### **Why `count = 1`?**

We are counting the length of **consecutive groups** of `0`s or `1`s.  
Since the first character itself is already part of a group, we **initialize `count = 1`** at the start.

### **Step-by-Step Example:**

Let's take **`s = "00110011"`** and see how we track group sizes.

#### **Initialization:**

```javascript
let count = 1; // The first character is counted as part of a group
```

We assume that the first character **already belongs to a group** (either `0` or `1`), so we count it.

---

#### **Loop Iteration (`i = 1` to `i = s.length - 1`)**

| Index | Char | Prev Char | `curr` Count | Action                                             |
| ----- | ---- | --------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | `0`  | -         | `1`          | First character starts a group                     |
| 1     | `0`  | `0`       | `2`          | Still in the same group (increment `curr`)         |
| 2     | `1`  | `0`       | `1` (reset)  | **New group starts** (update `prev`, reset `curr`) |
| 3     | `1`  | `1`       | `2`          | Still in the same group (increment `curr`)         |
| 4     | `0`  | `1`       | `1` (reset)  | **New group starts** (update `prev`, reset `curr`) |

---

### **What If We Started with `count = 0`?**

If we set `count = 0`, then the first character wouldn't be counted as part of a group. This would cause incorrect results, as the first group would always be missing one element.

Example (incorrect):

- `"0011"`
- If we start `count = 0`, the first group of `"00"` would only count `1`, instead of `2`.

---

### **Final Takeaway**

âœ… We start with `count = 1` **to ensure the first character is counted in its group**.  
âœ… This makes it easier to track consecutive groups and handle transitions between `0` and `1`.  
âœ… It prevents **off-by-one errors** when processing groups.

### **Purpose of `prev = 0` in the Two-Pointer Approach**

In the **two-pointer approach** for counting binary substrings, we use `prev` to keep track of the **size of the previous group** of `0`s or `1`s.

#### **Why do we initialize `prev = 0`?**

1. **Handles the first group properly**: Since there is no "previous group" before the first character, we initialize `prev = 0`.
2. **Ensures correct comparisons**: The first transition (from `0` to `1` or vice versa) updates `prev`, and we start counting valid substrings immediately.
3. **Prevents off-by-one errors**: Without `prev = 0`, the first transition wouldnâ€™t contribute to the result properly.

---

### **Step-by-Step Breakdown**

#### **Example: "00110011"**

Let's analyze how `prev` and `curr` change as we iterate:

```javascript
let prev = 0,
  curr = 1,
  result = 0;
```

| Index | Char | Prev Char | `curr` (Current group size) | `prev` (Previous group size) | Action                              |
| ----- | ---- | --------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 0     | `0`  | -         | `1`                         | `0`                          | First group starts                  |
| 1     | `0`  | `0`       | `2`                         | `0`                          | Still in the same group             |
| 2     | `1`  | `0`       | `1` (reset)                 | `2` (updated)                | **Transition â†’ Add `min(2,1) = 1`** |
| 3     | `1`  | `1`       | `2`                         | `2`                          | Still in the same group             |
| 4     | `0`  | `1`       | `1` (reset)                 | `2` (updated)                | **Transition â†’ Add `min(2,2) = 2`** |
| 5     | `0`  | `0`       | `2`                         | `2`                          | Still in the same group             |
| 6     | `1`  | `0`       | `1` (reset)                 | `2` (updated)                | **Transition â†’ Add `min(2,2) = 2`** |
| 7     | `1`  | `1`       | `2`                         | `2`                          | Still in the same group             |

At the end, we **add the last transition**:

```javascript
result += Math.min(prev, curr); // Add min(2,2) = 2
```

**Final result: `6`**

---

### **Key Takeaways**

âœ… `prev` stores the size of the last group.  
âœ… We **compare `prev` and `curr`** to count valid substrings.  
âœ… **Starting with `prev = 0` ensures the first transition is counted properly**.

This approach keeps **O(1) space** and runs in **O(N) time**. ðŸš€
