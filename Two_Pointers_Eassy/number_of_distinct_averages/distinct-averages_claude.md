# **2465. Number of Distinct Averages**

I'll guide you through solving the "2465. Number of Distinct Averages" LeetCode problem with a comprehensive, educational approach.

## **Problem Understanding**

Let's break down the problem statement:

- You are given an integer array `nums`
- The task is to find the number of distinct averages in the array
- An average is calculated by finding the sum of the smallest and largest numbers in a subset, then dividing by 2
- We want to count how many unique averages can be formed

## Constraints and Edge Cases

- 2 ≤ nums.length ≤ 50
- nums.length is even
- 1 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 50

## **Pattern Identification**

This problem requires:

- Sorting the array
- Creating unique averages
- Counting distinct values

The primary pattern here is **sorting and set manipulation**, which is common in problems involving unique combinations or distinct values.

## **Approach Discussion**

Here's a step-by-step solution strategy:

1. **Sort the Input Array**
   - Sorting allows us to easily pair the smallest and largest elements
   - This helps in systematically generating averages

2. **Generate Averages**
   - Use two pointers: one from the start, one from the end
   - Calculate average by summing smallest and largest elements
   - Move pointers towards the center

3. **Track Distinct Averages**
   - Use a Set to automatically eliminate duplicates
   - The Set will naturally store only unique average values

## **Code Implementation**

I'll implement this in JavaScript with detailed comments:

## **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
  - Sorting takes O(n log n)
  - Iterating through array takes O(n)
  - Set operations are O(1)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - Set stores unique averages
  - Sorting is typically done in-place for most JS implementations

## **Alternative Solutions**

While our current solution is quite efficient, an alternative approach could involve:

1. Using a hash map instead of a Set
2. Pre-calculating all possible pairings before adding to the set

## **Practice Recommendations**

Similar LeetCode problems to practice this pattern:

1. "1877. Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array"
2. "1968. Array With Elements Not Equal to Average of Neighbors"
3. "881. Boats to Save People"

## **Flowchart Visualization**

I'll create a flowchart to illustrate the solution:

## **Problem-Solving Insights**

Key takeaways from this problem:

1. Sorting can simplify pairing and combination problems
2. Sets are powerful for tracking unique values
3. Two-pointer technique is excellent for symmetric array operations

### Learning Strategy

To master this type of problem:

- Practice sorting and pairing techniques
- Understand how to manipulate arrays efficiently
- Learn to use built-in data structures like Set and Map
- Always consider time and space complexity trade-offs

## Mental Model

Think of this problem like matching dance partners:

- Sort the dancers by height
- Pair the tallest with the shortest
- Keep track of unique dance styles (averages)
