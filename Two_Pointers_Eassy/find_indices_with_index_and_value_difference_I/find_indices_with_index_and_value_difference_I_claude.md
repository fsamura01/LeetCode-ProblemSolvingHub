# Problem 2903: Find Indices With Index and Value Difference I

## Problem Understanding

Let me explain this problem in simple terms:

You're given an array of integers `nums` and two integers `indexDifference` and `valueDifference`. Your task is to find two indices `i` and `j` that satisfy these conditions:

1. The absolute difference between the indices is at least `indexDifference`: |i - j| ≥ indexDifference
2. The absolute difference between the values at these indices is at least `valueDifference`: |nums[i] - nums[j]| ≥ valueDifference

If such indices exist, you should return [i, j]. If multiple valid pairs exist, you can return any of them. If no such pair exists, return [-1, -1].

### Constraints

- The array length is between 2 and 100
- The array values are between 0 and 109
- Both `indexDifference` and `valueDifference` are non-negative integers
- The indices must be valid (within the array bounds)

## Pattern Identification

This problem doesn't cleanly fit into a single classic algorithmic pattern like sliding window or dynamic programming. Instead, it's a variant of a **search problem** where we need to find elements that satisfy certain conditions.

The most straightforward approach would be a **brute force search** with a nested loop to check all possible pairs of indices. Given the constraints (array size ≤ 100), this approach is actually quite reasonable from a time complexity perspective.

## Approach Discussion

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Iterate through all possible pairs of indices (i, j) in the array
2. For each pair, check if the index difference condition is met: |i - j| ≥ indexDifference
3. If the first condition is met, check if the value difference condition is also met: |nums[i] - nums[j]| ≥ valueDifference
4. If both conditions are satisfied, return the pair [i, j]
5. If no pair satisfies both conditions after checking all possibilities, return [-1, -1]

This approach ensures we check all possible pairs and find a valid solution if one exists.

## Code Implementation

Let's implement this approach in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} indexDifference
 * @param {number} valueDifference
 * @return {number[]}
 */
function findIndices(nums, indexDifference, valueDifference) {
    const n = nums.length;
    
    // Iterate through all possible pairs of indices
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            // Check if index difference condition is met
            if (Math.abs(i - j) >= indexDifference) {
                // Check if value difference condition is met
                if (Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) >= valueDifference) {
                    return [i, j];
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // If no valid pair is found, return [-1, -1]
    return [-1, -1];
}
```

The code follows our approach exactly. For each pair of indices (i, j), we check both conditions, and return the first valid pair we find. If no valid pair exists, we return [-1, -1].

## Optimization

We can optimize this solution slightly. Note that when we're at index i, we only need to check indices j that are at least indexDifference away. This means:

- j ≤ i - indexDifference, or
- j ≥ i + indexDifference

Let's update our code to reflect this optimization:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} indexDifference
 * @param {number} valueDifference
 * @return {number[]}
 */
function findIndices(nums, indexDifference, valueDifference) {
    const n = nums.length;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Only check indices j that satisfy the index difference condition
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (Math.abs(i - j) >= indexDifference) {
                if (Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) >= valueDifference) {
                    return [i, j];
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return [-1, -1];
}
```

## Further Optimization

Actually, we can make our solution even more efficient. Instead of having a nested loop with i and j, we can use a single loop approach:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} indexDifference
 * @param {number} valueDifference
 * @return {number[]}
 */
function findIndices(nums, indexDifference, valueDifference) {
    const n = nums.length;
    
    // For each possible i
    for (let i = indexDifference; i < n; i++) {
        const j = i - indexDifference;
        
        // Check if pair (j, i) satisfies the value difference
        if (Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) >= valueDifference) {
            return [j, i];
        }
    }
    
    return [-1, -1];
}
```

But wait, this approach is incomplete! It only checks pairs where j < i. We need to consider all possible pairs. Let's revert to our previous approach.

## Final Optimized Solution

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} indexDifference
 * @param {number} valueDifference
 * @return {number[]}
 */
function findIndices(nums, indexDifference, valueDifference) {
    const n = nums.length;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Only need to check indices j where j >= i + indexDifference 
        // (since if j < i, i would have already been considered as j in a previous iteration)
        for (let j = i + indexDifference; j < n; j++) {
            if (Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) >= valueDifference) {
                return [i, j];
            }
        }
    }
    
    return [-1, -1];
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(n²) in the worst case, where n is the length of the array. This is because we potentially need to check all pairs of indices.

Space Complexity: O(1), as we only use a constant amount of additional space regardless of the input size.

## Alternative Solutions

An alternative approach could use preprocessing to potentially speed up the search:

1. Create a sorted list of (value, index) pairs
2. For each index i, find potential indices j that satisfy both conditions

However, for this specific problem with the given constraints (array size ≤ 100), the brute force approach is likely the most straightforward and efficient.

## Practice Recommendations

For more practice with similar search patterns, I recommend these LeetCode problems:

1. "Two Sum" (Problem 1) - Finding a pair with a specific sum
2. "3Sum" (Problem 15) - Finding triplets with a specific sum
3. "Find All Anagrams in a String" (Problem 438) - Involves checking conditions across indices
4. "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" (Problem 3) - Finding elements that satisfy certain conditions
5. "Container With Most Water" (Problem 11) - Involves comparing values at different indices

## Flowchart Design

Let me create a flowchart to illustrate the solution:

## Key Takeaways

1. **Understand the problem thoroughly**: Make sure you understand all constraints and requirements before diving into a solution.

2. **Consider brute force first**: For smaller inputs (n ≤ 100 in this case), a brute force approach may be perfectly acceptable and easier to implement.

3. **Look for optimizations**: Even in brute force approaches, look for ways to optimize, such as avoiding unnecessary checks (we did this by only considering j ≥ i + indexDifference).

4. **Edge cases**: Always consider edge cases. For this problem, make sure your solution handles scenarios where no valid indices exist.

5. **Complexity awareness**: Always be aware of the time and space complexity of your solution, especially if the input size might be large.

This problem teaches us that sometimes the straightforward approach is the best, especially when the problem constraints allow for it. The key insight was recognizing that we could optimize our search by only looking at pairs with sufficient index difference.

## **When to Use the Brute Force Approach**

Brute force is often viewed as a less sophisticated problem-solving method, but it has legitimate applications in algorithmic design. Understanding when to use brute force rather than more complex approaches is an important skill for competitive programming.

## **Appropriate Scenarios for Brute Force**

### **1. Small Input Sizes**

As we saw with the "Find Indices" problem, when the constraints specify small input sizes (e.g., array length ≤ 100), brute force solutions are often perfectly acceptable. The time complexity might be theoretically worse (O(n²)), but for small n, the actual runtime is negligible.

**Example**: For an array of size 100, checking all pairs means examining about 10,000 combinations—well within the capabilities of modern computers to process almost instantly.

### **2. Problem Complexity Requires It**

Some problems simply don't have more efficient algorithmic solutions. In these cases, brute force (perhaps with optimizations) may be the only practical approach.

**Example**: Certain NP-hard problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem for general cases ultimately require examining many combinations, though heuristics can help reduce the search space.

### **3. As a Verification Method**

Even when implementing an optimized algorithm, implementing a brute force solution first can help:

- Verify the correctness of your optimized solution against known test cases
- Debug edge cases more effectively
- Understand the problem domain more thoroughly

### **4. Time Constraints During Interviews or Competitions**

During coding interviews or timed competitions, implementing a working brute force solution first demonstrates:

- You can solve the problem at a basic level
- You understand the problem requirements
- You can code a working solution quickly

You can then discuss or implement optimizations if time permits.

### **5. When Optimizations Don't Significantly Improve Complexity**

If the best optimization only improves the solution by a constant factor (e.g., from O(n²) to O(n²/2)), the brute force approach with simple optimizations may be preferred for its clarity and lower risk of bugs.

## **Advantages of Brute Force**

1. **Simplicity**: Easier to implement, understand, and debug
2. **Reliability**: Less prone to edge case errors than complex algorithms
3. **Guaranteed to find the optimal solution** (assuming correct implementation)
4. **Serves as a baseline** for measuring optimized approaches

## **When to Avoid Brute Force**

1. **Large Input Sizes**: When n is large (e.g., 10⁵ or higher), O(n²) or worse algorithms will time out
2. **Real-time Applications**: When processing speed is critical
3. **When efficient algorithms exist**: For well-known problems like shortest paths (Dijkstra's) or minimum spanning trees (Kruskal's)
4. **Memory Constraints**: When brute force would exceed available memory

## **Optimizing Brute Force**

Even when using brute force, look for simple optimizations:

1. **Early termination**: Return as soon as a valid solution is found (as we did in the indices problem)
2. **Symmetry elimination**: If checking pairs (i,j) and (j,i) would yield the same result, only check one
3. **Constraint-based pruning**: Use problem constraints to avoid unnecessary checks (as we did by only checking j ≥ i + indexDifference)
4. **Preprocessing**: Sometimes sorting or other preprocessing can make the brute force search more efficient

## **Decision Framework**

Ask yourself these questions when deciding whether to use brute force:

1. What is the input size constraint? (Small → Brute force may work)
2. What is the time limit for the solution? (Generous → Brute force may work)
3. Is there a known efficient algorithm for this class of problem?
4. Will my brute force solution exceed memory limits?
5. Can I optimize the brute force approach to make it viable?

Remember, in competitive programming and real-world software development, using the simplest approach that meets the requirements is often the optimal strategy. Don't over-engineer solutions when brute force is sufficient.
