# **2903. Find Indices With Index and Value Difference I**

## **Step 1: Problem Understanding**  

The **LeetCode Problem 2903: "Find Indices With Index and Value Difference I"** requires us to find two indices `i` and `j` in an array such that:  

1. `|i - j| >= indexDifference` (The difference in indices is at least `indexDifference`).
2. `|nums[i] - nums[j]| >= valueDifference` (The absolute difference in values is at least `valueDifference`).

If such indices exist, return them as `[i, j]`. Otherwise, return `[-1, -1]`.  

### **Constraints & Edge Cases:**  

- The array `nums` can have `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`, so an `O(n²)` brute-force solution might be feasible.
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10⁶`, meaning large values but no negative numbers.
- `indexDifference` and `valueDifference` are at least `1`, ensuring that meaningful comparisons are required.
- Edge cases:
  - Small arrays (e.g., `[1, 2]` with `indexDifference = 1`).
  - Large `indexDifference` values making it impossible to find valid indices.
  - Cases where all values are close together or identical.

---

## **Step 2: Pattern Identification**  

Since we are searching for a valid pair `(i, j)`, the problem can be solved in multiple ways:  

1. **Brute Force (`O(n²)`)**: Iterate over all pairs `(i, j)` and check the conditions.  
2. **Sliding Window / Two Pointers (`O(n)`)**: If sorted or structured properly, we could use a moving window to find valid pairs efficiently.  
3. **Ordered Data Structure (`O(n log n)`)**: A **balanced BST (like `TreeSet`)** or **deque** could be used to maintain a window of elements and efficiently query for valid differences.

Since the constraints allow `O(n²)`, we start with brute force and then discuss optimizations.

## **Step 3: Approach Discussion (Brute Force - `O(n²)`)**

We check all possible pairs `(i, j)`, ensuring `|i - j| >= indexDifference` and `|nums[i] - nums[j]| >= valueDifference`.  

### **Steps:**

1. Iterate over all indices `i`.
2. For each `i`, check all `j` where `j >= i + indexDifference`.
3. If a valid `(i, j)` pair is found, return `[i, j]`.
4. If no valid pair exists, return `[-1, -1]`.

---

## **Step 4: Code Implementation (JavaScript)**

```javascript
var findIndices = function(nums, indexDifference, valueDifference) {
    let n = nums.length;

    // Iterate through each possible i
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Iterate through each valid j
        for (let j = i + indexDifference; j < n; j++) {
            // Check if the value difference condition is met
            if (Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) >= valueDifference) {
                return [i, j];  // Found valid indices
            }
        }
    }

    return [-1, -1];  // No valid indices found
};
```

✅ **Key Points:**

- We iterate through every `i` and check only valid `j` (`j >= i + indexDifference`).
- If a valid pair is found, we immediately return it.
- If no pair is found, return `[-1, -1]`.

---

## **Step 5: Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**:  
  - The worst case involves checking all pairs `(i, j)`, leading to `O(n²)`.
  - Given `n ≤ 1000`, this is acceptable.
- **Space Complexity**:  
  - `O(1)`, since we only use a few integer variables.

---

## **Step 6: Alternative Solutions & Optimizations**

### **1. Sliding Window / Deque (`O(n log n)`)**  

Instead of checking all pairs, we can maintain a **deque** or **ordered set** (like `TreeSet` in Java) that holds values within a valid window.

### **2. Sorting & Binary Search (`O(n log n)`)**  

If the array is preprocessed and sorted, we can use **binary search** (`O(log n)`) to find valid `j` for each `i`.  
*Downside:* Sorting breaks the original index order, requiring additional mapping.

## **Step 8: Flowchart Design**

A visual breakdown of the solution:

1. Start with index `i = 0`
2. Loop through `i` to `n-1`
3. For each `i`, loop through `j = i + indexDifference` to `n-1`
4. Check:
   - `|nums[i] - nums[j]| >= valueDifference`
   - If yes → return `[i, j]`
5. If loop completes → return `[-1, -1]`

I'll generate a **flowchart** to illustrate this.

Here's the flowchart illustrating the solution's logical flow. It visually represents the loops, condition checks, and the decision-making process for returning the correct indices.

## **Certainly! Let's break down the JavaScript loop statement:**

```javascript
for (let j = i + indexDifference; j < n; j++) {
    // Code block
}
```

### **Step-by-Step Explanation**

1. **Initialization (`let j = i + indexDifference`)**  
   - The loop variable `j` is initialized to `i + indexDifference`.  
   - This ensures that `j` starts at a position that maintains the minimum required index difference.

2. **Condition (`j < n`)**  
   - The loop continues executing as long as `j` is **less than `n`** (the length of the array).  
   - If `j` reaches `n`, the loop stops.

3. **Increment (`j++`)**  
   - After each iteration, `j` is incremented by `1`.  
   - This ensures that `j` moves forward step by step.

### **Example Execution**

#### **Given Data**

```javascript
let nums = [3, 5, 8, 2, 10]; 
let indexDifference = 2;
let n = nums.length; // n = 5

for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    console.log(`Outer loop i: ${i}`);
    for (let j = i + indexDifference; j < n; j++) {
        console.log(`  Inner loop j: ${j}`);
    }
}
```

#### **Step-by-Step Iterations**

| `i` | `j = i + indexDifference` | `j` Iterates Up To |
|----|-------------------------|-----------------|
| 0  | `0 + 2 = 2`            | `2 → 3 → 4`     |
| 1  | `1 + 2 = 3`            | `3 → 4`         |
| 2  | `2 + 2 = 4`            | `4`             |
| 3  | `3 + 2 = 5` (out of bounds) | No iterations |
| 4  | `4 + 2 = 6` (out of bounds) | No iterations |

#### **Output**

```javascript
Outer loop i: 0
  Inner loop j: 2
  Inner loop j: 3
  Inner loop j: 4
Outer loop i: 1
  Inner loop j: 3
  Inner loop j: 4
Outer loop i: 2
  Inner loop j: 4
Outer loop i: 3
Outer loop i: 4
```

### **Why is `j` initialized as `i + indexDifference`?**

- This ensures that **each pair `(i, j)` meets the condition** `|i - j| >= indexDifference` automatically.
- It avoids unnecessary checks for smaller `j` values, making the code more efficient.
