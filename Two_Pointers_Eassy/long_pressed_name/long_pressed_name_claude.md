# **925. Long Pressed Name**

Let me guide you through solving the "Long Pressed Name" problem with a focus on developing your problem-solving skills and pattern recognition.

## Problem Understanding

Let's break down what this problem is asking us to solve:

Given two strings `name` and `typed`, we need to determine if the typed string could have been created by someone holding down certain keys for too long while trying to type the original name.

For example:

- If name = "alex" and typed = "aaleex", the answer is true because the 'a' and 'e' keys might have been pressed too long
- If name = "saeed" and typed = "ssaaedd", the answer is false because the second 'd' is missing

Key constraints:

- Both strings contain only lowercase English letters
- name.length ≤ 1000
- typed.length ≤ 1000

## Pattern Identification

This problem exhibits characteristics of the "Two Pointers" pattern, specifically:

- We need to compare two strings
- We're moving through both strings sequentially
- We need to track positions in both strings independently

## Approach Discussion

Let's develop our solution step by step:

1. We'll use two pointers: one for the name string (i) and one for the typed string (j)
2. For each character in the typed string, we have two possible scenarios:
   - The character matches the current character in name
   - The character matches the previous character in typed (representing a long press)
3. If neither condition is met, we know the typed string cannot match
4. We need to ensure we've used all characters in both strings

## Code Implementation

Let me write a clearly commented solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} name - The original name to be typed
 * @param {string} typed - The actually typed string
 * @return {boolean} - Whether typed could have been created by long-pressing name
 */
function isLongPressedName(name, typed) {
  // Initialize pointers for both strings
  let namePointer = 0;
  let typedPointer = 0;

  // Process both strings
  while (typedPointer < typed.length) {
    // Case 1: Characters match - advance both pointers
    if (
      namePointer < name.length &&
      name[namePointer] === typed[typedPointer]
    ) {
      namePointer++;
      typedPointer++;
    }
    // Case 2: Long-pressed key - check if it matches previous character
    else if (
      typedPointer > 0 &&
      typed[typedPointer] === typed[typedPointer - 1]
    ) {
      typedPointer++;
    }
    // Case 3: No match possible
    else {
      return false;
    }
  }

  // Verify we've used all characters in name
  return namePointer === name.length;
}
```

## Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(max(N, T)) where N is the length of name and T is the length of typed

- We traverse both strings once
- At each step, we make constant time comparisons

Space Complexity: O(1)

- We only use two pointers regardless of input size
- No additional data structures are needed

## Alternative Solutions

An alternative approach could use a grouping strategy:

1. Group consecutive identical characters in both strings
2. Compare the groups:
   - Each group in name must match corresponding group in typed
   - Typed groups must be at least as long as name groups

This approach might be more intuitive for some, but has the same complexity and requires more space.

## Practice Recommendations

Similar problems to practice this pattern:

1. LeetCode #844 - "Backspace String Compare"
2. LeetCode #443 - "String Compression"
3. LeetCode #1047 - "Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String"

4. Flowchart

Let me create a flowchart to visualize the solution process:

Key Insights for Interviews:

1. The two-pointer technique is powerful for string comparison problems
2. Always consider edge cases like empty strings or strings of different lengths
3. Breaking down the problem into distinct cases (match, long press, no match) makes the solution clearer
4. The solution maintains O(1) space complexity by processing characters in-place

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the solution or discuss specific edge cases in more detail?
