# **2511. Maximum Enemy Forts That Can Be Captured**

I'll guide you through solving the "Maximum Enemy Forts That Can Be Captured" LeetCode problem systematically.

## **Problem Understanding**

Let's break down the problem statement:

- You are given a 0-indexed binary array `forts` of length `n`
- The array contains only 0s and 1s
- You can move from a point in the array to another point
- You can capture enemy forts located between your starting and ending positions
- The goal is to maximize the number of enemy forts captured

Key constraints:

- 1 ≤ n ≤ 105
- `forts[i]` is either 0 or 1
- At most one movement is allowed

## **Pattern Identification**

This problem primarily uses the **Two Pointers** pattern with elements of **Linear Scanning**. The key is to:

1. Identify potential starting and ending points
2. Check the elements between these points
3. Keep track of the maximum number of capturable forts

## **Approach Discussion**

The solution involves these steps:

1. Iterate through the array to find potential player positions (1s)
2. For each player position, look in both left and right directions
3. Count the number of enemy forts (0s) between the player and the fort
4. Keep track of the maximum number of forts that can be captured

## **Code Implementation**

Here's a JavaScript solution:

## **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: O(n²), where n is the length of the array
  - We iterate through each position once (O(n))
  - For each position, we may scan in both directions (O(n))
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We use only a constant amount of extra space
  - No additional data structures are created

## **Alternative Solutions**

1. **Single Pass Optimization**
   - Potentially reduce time complexity to O(n)
   - Keep track of previous player and enemy positions in a single pass

## **Flowchart Visualization**

Let's create a flowchart to illustrate the solution:

## **Practice Recommendations**

2. Trapping Rain Water
3. Move Zeroes
4. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

## **Key Learning Points**

- Two-pointer technique is powerful for linear array traversal
- Breaking down complex scanning problems into directional checks
- Importance of helper functions to modularize code
- Handling edge cases in array traversal

Mental Model Exercise:
Try to visualize the array as a landscape where:

- 1 represents a player's position
- 0 represents potential enemy forts
- Your goal is to find the longest continuous stretch of enemy forts between two player positions

Debugging Tips:

- Always consider edge cases:
  1. Empty array
  2. No player positions
  3. Players at the beginning or end of the array
- Use console.log to track intermediate values during problem-solving

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the solution or discuss any specific aspect in more depth?

Let me break down these conditions in detail and provide clarity through examples and explanations.

## **Condition Breakdown**

### **Index Constraint:** `0 <= i, j <= n - 1`

This is a standard array indexing constraint that ensures:

- The start and end positions (i and j) are valid indices within the array
- For an array of length n, valid indices range from 0 to n-1
- Prevents out-of-bounds access to the array

#### **Example**

Let's consider an array: `[1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`

- Valid indices are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
- n = 5
- You can start at index 0 or 4 (the player positions)

#### **Movement Constraint: Enemy Forts Only**

The key phrase is: "The army travels over enemy forts **only**"

This means:

1. You can only move between two player positions (1s)
2. ALL positions between these player positions MUST be enemy forts (0s)
3. No other types of positions are allowed between the start and end

Let's visualize this with multiple examples:

#### **Valid Scenarios**

```javascript
1. [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  ✅ Allowed
   - Start at index 0
   - End at index 4
   - All middle positions (1, 2, 3) are enemy forts (0s)
   - Capturable forts: 3

2. [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1]  ✅ Allowed
   - Start at index 0
   - End at index 2
   - Middle position is an enemy fort (0)
   - Capturable forts: 1

3. [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]  ✅ Allowed
   - Multiple valid paths
   - Capturable forts from first path: 3
   - Capturable forts from second path: 2
```

#### **Invalid Scenarios**

```javascript
1. [1, 0, 1, 0, 1]  ❌ Not Allowed
   - Contains a player fort (1) in the middle of movement
   - Breaks the "enemy forts only" rule

2. [1, 0, 2, 0, 1]  ❌ Not Allowed
   - Contains an invalid fort type (2)
   - Only 0s and 1s are permitted

3. [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]  ❌ Not Allowed
   - Multiple player forts consecutively
   - Cannot have adjacent player forts during movement
```

## **Formal Mathematical Representation**

For movement from index i to j:

```javascript
Formally: ∀k ∈ [min(i,j), max(i,j)], forts[k] == 0
```

Translated: For every index k between the minimum and maximum of i and j, the value must be 0.

## **Code Illustration**

Let me update the previous solution to explicitly check this constraint:

## **Mental Model and Learning Points**

### **Thinking Strategy**

1. Visualize the array as a battlefield
2. Players can only move through empty territories
3. Goal is to maximize conquered territory

### **Common Misconceptions to Avoid**

- Not every 0 between 1s is automatically capturable
- Must be a continuous stretch of enemy forts
- Cannot jump over other player positions

## **Reflection Questions**

1. How would you modify the solution if the rules changed slightly?
2. What would happen if diagonal or non-linear movements were allowed?
3. Can you think of a real-world scenario that mimics this problem's constraints?

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the explanation or discuss the solution's nuances further?
