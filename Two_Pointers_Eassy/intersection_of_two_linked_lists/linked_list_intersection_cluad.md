<!-- I'll provide a step-by-step solution with two approaches:
a hash set solution and a two-pointer solution that meets the follow-up challenge of O(1) memory usage. -->

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */

// Solution 1: Hash Set Approach
function getIntersectionNode1(headA, headB) {
  // Create a Set to store nodes from list A
  const nodesInA = new Set();

  // Traverse list A and store all nodes
  let current = headA;
  while (current !== null) {
    nodesInA.add(current);
    current = current.next;
  }

  // Traverse list B and check for intersection
  current = headB;
  while (current !== null) {
    if (nodesInA.has(current)) {
      return current;
    }
    current = current.next;
  }

  return null;
}

// Solution 2: Two Pointer Approach (O(1) space)
function getIntersectionNode2(headA, headB) {
  // Handle edge cases
  if (headA === null || headB === null) {
    return null;
  }

  // Initialize pointers
  let pointerA = headA;
  let pointerB = headB;

  // Traverse both lists
  while (pointerA !== pointerB) {
    // Move pointer A
    pointerA = pointerA === null ? headB : pointerA.next;

    // Move pointer B
    pointerB = pointerB === null ? headA : pointerB.next;
  }

  // Return intersection node (or null if no intersection)
  return pointerA;
}
```

Let's analyze both solutions:

Solution 1: Hash Set Approach

1. Create a Set to store nodes from list A
2. Traverse list A and add all nodes to the Set
3. Traverse list B and check if each node exists in the Set
4. Return the first node found in both lists, or null if none found

Time Complexity: O(m + n) where m and n are the lengths of the lists
Space Complexity: O(m) to store nodes from list A

Solution 2: Two Pointer Approach
This clever solution uses the fact that both pointers will travel the same total distance.

How it works:

1. Use two pointers starting at the heads of both lists
2. When a pointer reaches the end of its list, redirect it to the head of the other list
3. Continue until pointers meet (intersection) or both reach null (no intersection)

Mathematical proof:

- Let's say:
  - List A length before intersection = a
  - List B length before intersection = b
  - Length after intersection = c
- Pointer A travels: a + c + b
- Pointer B travels: b + c + a
- Both travel the same distance and will meet at intersection

Time Complexity: O(m + n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Edge cases handled:

1. Empty lists
2. Lists of different lengths
3. No intersection
4. Intersection at various positions

The Two Pointer solution (Solution 2) is superior because it:

1. Uses constant space O(1)
2. Maintains the original structure
3. Works with all valid inputs
4. Is elegant and relatively simple

Implementation notes:

- We compare node references, not values
- The solution handles lists of different lengths naturally
- No modification of input lists is required
- Works even when intersection is at the start or end

The two-pointer approach is particularly clever because it eliminates the need for:

- Calculating list lengths
- Extra space storage
- Multiple passes through the lists

This problem teaches us that sometimes a simple pointer manipulation can solve what initially seems to require additional space complexity.
