<!-- I'll provide a step-by-step solution with two approaches:
a hash set solution and a two-pointer solution that meets the follow-up challenge of O(1) memory usage. -->

#

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */

/* Solution 1: Hash Set Approach */ 
function getIntersectionNode1(headA, headB) {
  // Create a Set to store nodes from list A
  const nodesInA = new Set();

  // Traverse list A and store all nodes
  let current = headA;
  while (current !== null) {
    nodesInA.add(current);
    current = current.next;
  }

  // Traverse list B and check for intersection
  current = headB;
  while (current !== null) {
    if (nodesInA.has(current)) {
      return current;
    }
    current = current.next;
  }

  return null;
}

// Solution 2: Two Pointer Approach (O(1) space)
function getIntersectionNode2(headA, headB) {
  // Handle edge cases
  if (headA === null || headB === null) {
    return null;
  }

  // Initialize pointers
  let pointerA = headA;
  let pointerB = headB;

  // Traverse both lists
  while (pointerA !== pointerB) {
    // Move pointer A
    pointerA = pointerA === null ? headB : pointerA.next;

    // Move pointer B
    pointerB = pointerB === null ? headA : pointerB.next;
  }

  // Return intersection node (or null if no intersection)
  return pointerA;
}
```

Let's analyze both solutions:

Solution 1: Hash Set Approach

1. Create a Set to store nodes from list A
2. Traverse list A and add all nodes to the Set
3. Traverse list B and check if each node exists in the Set
4. Return the first node found in both lists, or null if none found

Time Complexity: O(m + n) where m and n are the lengths of the lists
Space Complexity: O(m) to store nodes from list A

Solution 2: Two Pointer Approach
This clever solution uses the fact that both pointers will travel the same total distance.

How it works:

1. Use two pointers starting at the heads of both lists
2. When a pointer reaches the end of its list, redirect it to the head of the other list
3. Continue until pointers meet (intersection) or both reach null (no intersection)

Mathematical proof:

- Let's say:
  - List A length before intersection = a
  - List B length before intersection = b
  - Length after intersection = c
- Pointer A travels: a + c + b
- Pointer B travels: b + c + a
- Both travel the same distance and will meet at intersection

Time Complexity: O(m + n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Edge cases handled:

1. Empty lists
2. Lists of different lengths
3. No intersection
4. Intersection at various positions

The Two Pointer solution (Solution 2) is superior because it:

1. Uses constant space O(1)
2. Maintains the original structure
3. Works with all valid inputs
4. Is elegant and relatively simple

Implementation notes:

- We compare node references, not values
- The solution handles lists of different lengths naturally
- No modification of input lists is required
- Works even when intersection is at the start or end

The two-pointer approach is particularly clever because it eliminates the need for:

- Calculating list lengths
- Extra space storage
- Multiple passes through the lists

## **I'd be happy to guide you through solving this linked list intersection problem. Let's break it down systematically so you can understand both the problem and the underlying patterns.**

### **1. Problem Understanding**

In simple terms, we have two linked lists, and we need to find if and where they intersect. An intersection occurs when both lists share the same node (same memory reference, not just the same value). If they intersect, we need to return that node; otherwise, we return null.

Key points to understand:

- Intersection means the exact same node in memory, not just nodes with the same value
- After the intersection point, both lists share all remaining nodes
- The original structure of both lists must be preserved
- We need to find an efficient solution with O(m+n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity

### **2. Pattern Identification**

This problem involves traversing linked lists, and we need to identify a specific pattern. The core pattern here is the **Two-Pointer Technique**, which is particularly useful for linked list problems. In particular, we'll use a variation that helps identify a meeting point in two different paths.

### **3. Approach Discussion**

Let's think about how to approach this problem:

1. **Naive Approach (Not Optimal)**: We could use a hash set to track all nodes in list A, then check each node in list B to see if it's in the set. This works but uses O(m) extra space.

2. **Length Difference Approach**: We can find the length of both lists, calculate the difference, and then advance the pointer in the longer list by that difference before starting to compare nodes.

3. **Two-Pointer Approach (Optimal)**: This is the most elegant solution. We'll use two pointers, one for each list. When a pointer reaches the end of its list, we redirect it to the head of the other list. This way, both pointers will travel the same total distance before meeting at the intersection point (if one exists).

Let's elaborate on the two-pointer approach:

Imagine two people walking on different paths that eventually merge. If both people walk at the same speed:

- Person A walks path A, then path B
- Person B walks path B, then path A

If the paths merge at some point, both people will meet at the intersection point after walking the same total distance.

### **4. Code Implementation**

Let's implement the two-pointer approach in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.next = null;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {ListNode} headA
 * @param {ListNode} headB
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var getIntersectionNode = function(headA, headB) {
    // Edge case: if either list is empty, there can't be an intersection
    if (!headA || !headB) return null;
    
    // Initialize pointers for both lists
    let pointerA = headA;
    let pointerB = headB;
    
    // Continue until pointers meet or both reach null
    while (pointerA !== pointerB) {
        // If we've reached the end of list A, switch to list B
        // Otherwise, move to the next node in list A
        pointerA = pointerA ? pointerA.next : headB;
        
        // If we've reached the end of list B, switch to list A
        // Otherwise, move to the next node in list B
        pointerB = pointerB ? pointerB.next : headA;
    }
    
    // At this point, pointers are either both null (no intersection)
    // or they're pointing to the intersection node
    return pointerA;
};
```

### **5. Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity**: O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of lists A and B respectively. Each pointer traverses at most m + n nodes.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use two pointers regardless of the input size.

### **6. Algorithm Walkthrough**

Let's trace through Example 1 to understand how this works:

- listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5]
- Intersection at node with value 8

Step-by-step:

1. pointerA starts at node with value 4 in listA
2. pointerB starts at node with value 5 in listB
3. pointerA traverses listA: 4 → 1 → 8 → 4 → 5 → null, then switches to listB
4. pointerB traverses listB: 5 → 6 → 1 → 8 → 4 → 5 → null, then switches to listA
5. pointerA continues: 5 → 6 → 1 → 8 (listB nodes)
6. pointerB continues: 4 → 1 → 8 (listA nodes)
7. At this point, both pointers meet at node 8, which is the intersection

Why does this work? Both pointers travel the same total distance:

- pointerA: (length of listA before intersection) + (length of listB before intersection)
- pointerB: (length of listB before intersection) + (length of listA before intersection)

If there's an intersection, they must meet there. If not, both will eventually become null.

### **7. Alternative Solutions**

#### **Length Difference Approach**

Another common approach is to find the lengths of both lists, calculate their difference, and then advance the pointer of the longer list by that difference:

```javascript
var getIntersectionNode = function(headA, headB) {
    if (!headA || !headB) return null;
    
    // Calculate length of list A
    let lengthA = 0;
    let currentA = headA;
    while (currentA) {
        lengthA++;
        currentA = currentA.next;
    }
    
    // Calculate length of list B
    let lengthB = 0;
    let currentB = headB;
    while (currentB) {
        lengthB++;
        currentB = currentB.next;
    }
    
    // Reset pointers to the beginning
    let pointerA = headA;
    let pointerB = headB;
    
    // If list A is longer, advance pointerA
    if (lengthA > lengthB) {
        for (let i = 0; i < lengthA - lengthB; i++) {
            pointerA = pointerA.next;
        }
    }
    // If list B is longer, advance pointerB
    else if (lengthB > lengthA) {
        for (let i = 0; i < lengthB - lengthA; i++) {
            pointerB = pointerB.next;
        }
    }
    
    // Now both pointers are the same distance from the end
    // Traverse both lists until intersection is found
    while (pointerA !== pointerB) {
        pointerA = pointerA.next;
        pointerB = pointerB.next;
    }
    
    return pointerA; // Will be null if no intersection
};
```

This approach also has O(m + n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity but requires more code.

### **9. Understanding the Pattern and Its Applications**

The two-pointer technique used in this problem is extremely valuable for many linked list and array problems. Key insights from this approach:

1. **Cycle Detection**: This technique is related to Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm (also known as the "tortoise and hare" algorithm).

2. **Path Equalization**: By redirecting pointers when they reach the end of their lists, we equalize the paths they travel, making it easier to identify the meeting point.

3. **Elegant Memory Usage**: The solution achieves O(1) space complexity by using just two pointers, demonstrating how clever algorithms can often outperform brute force approaches.

### **10. Practice Recommendations**

Here are similar problems you can practice to reinforce this pattern:

1. **Linked List Cycle** (LeetCode 141) - Determine if a linked list has a cycle
2. **Linked List Cycle II** (LeetCode 142) - Find the starting point of a cycle in a linked list
3. **Middle of the Linked List** (LeetCode 876) - Find the middle node of a linked list
4. **Remove Nth Node From End of List** (LeetCode 19) - Remove the nth node from the end of a list

### **Summary**

The intersection of two linked lists problem teaches us the power of the two-pointer technique. The solution is elegant because:

1. It avoids using additional data structures (O(1) space)
2. It has an optimal time complexity of O(m + n)
3. It leverages the properties of linked lists to create a mathematical insight: if two paths have different lengths but you want to find their meeting point, you can equalize the distances by having pointers switch paths.

This problem-solving pattern extends beyond just finding intersections and can be applied to many other linked list and array challenges where you need to find meeting points, cycles, or manipulate elements at different positions.
