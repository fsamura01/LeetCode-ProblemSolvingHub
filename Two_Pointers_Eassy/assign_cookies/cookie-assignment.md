Let me walk you through how this solution works:

1. We start by sorting both arrays in ascending order. This is crucial because:

   - It allows us to match cookies with children optimally
   - We can ensure we're always using the smallest possible cookie that will satisfy a child

2. We then use two pointers to track:

   - The current cookie we're trying to assign
   - The current child we're trying to satisfy

3. The main algorithm logic:

   - If the current cookie size is sufficient for the current child (s[cookieIndex] >= g[childIndex]):
     - We increment our count of content children
     - Move to the next child
   - In either case, we move to the next cookie

4. This continues until we either:
   - Run out of cookies (cookieIndex >= s.length)
   - Or run out of children (childIndex >= g.length)

The solution is optimal because:

- By sorting both arrays, we ensure we're always trying to satisfy the least greedy child with the smallest possible cookie
- Once we make an assignment, we don't need to reconsider it because it's guaranteed to be optimal due to the sorting

The key insight is that this is a greedy algorithm - we always try to make the locally optimal choice (using the smallest possible cookie to satisfy the least greedy child), and this leads to a globally optimal solution.

Would you like me to explain any particular part in more detail?
