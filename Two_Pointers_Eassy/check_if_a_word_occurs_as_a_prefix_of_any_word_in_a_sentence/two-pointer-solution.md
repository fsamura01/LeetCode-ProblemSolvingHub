# **Two Pointer Solution**

I'll help you solve this problem using the two-pointer technique, which offers an interesting alternative approach that avoids splitting the string.

Let's think about how we can use two pointers effectively here. Instead of splitting the sentence into words, we can:

1. Use one pointer to track the start of each word
2. Use another pointer to check characters within the word
3. Keep track of which word number we're currently examining

Let me create a visual representation of how the two pointers move through the sentence:

Let's break down why this two-pointer approach is interesting and different from our previous solution:

1. Space Efficiency:

   - We don't create any new strings or arrays
   - We work directly with the original sentence
   - Space complexity is O(1) instead of O(N)

2. Single Pass:

   - We only traverse the sentence once
   - Each character is examined exactly once
   - Time complexity remains O(N)

3. Pointer Roles:

   - `wordStart`: Marks the beginning of each word we examine
   - `i`: Moves through the sentence character by character
   - `wordCount`: Keeps track of our position for the 1-based index return value

4. Key Insights:
   The solution hinges on two main ideas:
   - Word boundaries are marked by spaces or the end of the sentence
   - We can check prefixes by comparing characters sequentially from the word start

Let's look at how the pointers move through an example:

```javascript
sentence = "i love eating burger";
searchWord = "burg";

// Initial state:
(wordStart = 0), (i = 0), (wordCount = 1);
// Looking at: "i"

// After first word:
(wordStart = 2), (i = 2), (wordCount = 2);
// Looking at: "love"

// After second word:
(wordStart = 7), (i = 7), (wordCount = 3);
// Looking at: "eating"

// At final word:
(wordStart = 13), (i = 13), (wordCount = 4);
// Looking at: "burger" -> Match found!
```

This solution has several advantages:

1. Memory efficient - no additional data structures needed
2. More precise control over the search process
3. Potentially faster for very long sentences with short words
4. Doesn't rely on string splitting methods

One potential improvement we could make would be to add early termination if we find that the remaining sentence is shorter than our search word:

```javascript
if (sentence.length - wordStart < searchWord.length) {
  return -1; // Remaining text is too short to contain our prefix
}
```

Would you like me to explain any particular part of this solution in more detail? Or shall we explore how this approach might be adapted for similar string processing problems?
