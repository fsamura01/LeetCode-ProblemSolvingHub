# **844. Backspace String Compare**

## I'll guide you through solving the "844. Backspace String Compare" problem with a comprehensive, step-by-step approach

### 1. Problem Understanding

The problem asks us to compare two strings after processing backspace characters. In this problem:

- A '#' character represents a backspace operation
- When a backspace is encountered, the previous character is deleted
- We need to determine if the final processed strings are identical

**Example:**

- Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
- Processed s becomes "ac"
- Processed t becomes "ac"
- Result: true (both strings are the same after processing)

**Key Constraints:**

- 1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200
- Characters are lowercase English letters or '#'
- The problem requires us to handle multiple consecutive backspaces

### 2. Pattern Identification

This problem is an excellent example of the **Two Pointers** pattern, specifically a **Reverse Traversal** technique. By processing the strings from the end, we can efficiently handle backspaces without using extra space.

### 3. Approach Discussion

We'll use a two-pointer approach with the following strategy:

1. Start from the end of both strings
2. Keep track of backspace counts for each string
3. Skip characters based on backspace counts
4. Compare characters when we find valid characters
5. Continue until we've processed both strings completely

### 4. Code Implementation

Here's a JavaScript implementation that solves the problem:

```javascript
- @param {string} s
- @param {string} t
- @return {boolean}
  \*/
  var backspaceCompare = function(s, t) {
  // Helper function to get the next valid character index
  const getNextValidChar = (str, index) => {
  let backspaceCount = 0;

          // Move backwards, counting backspaces
          while (index >= 0) {
              if (str[index] === '#') {
                  backspaceCount++;
              } else if (backspaceCount > 0) {
                  // Skip this character due to backspaces
                  backspaceCount--;
              } else {
                  // Found a valid character to compare
                  break;
              }
              index--;
          }

          return index;
      };

      // Start from the end of both strings
      let i = s.length - 1;
      let j = t.length - 1;

      while (i >= 0 || j >= 0) {
          // Find next valid characters in both strings
          i = getNextValidChar(s, i);
          j = getNextValidChar(t, j);

          // Compare characters
          if (i >= 0 && j >= 0 && s[i] !== t[j]) {
              return false;
          }

          // Check if we've reached the beginning of one string but not the other
          if ((i >= 0) !== (j >= 0)) {
              return false;
          }

          // Move to previous characters
          i--;
          j--;
      }

      // Strings are equivalent after processing
      return true;

  };

// Test cases
console.log(backspaceCompare("ab#c", "ad#c")); // true
console.log(backspaceCompare("ab##", "c#d#")); // true
console.log(backspaceCompare("a#c", "b")); // false
```

### 5. Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input strings
  - We traverse each string at most twice
  - The `getNextValidChar` function ensures we process each character efficiently
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - We use only a constant amount of extra space
  - No additional data structures are created

### 6. Alternative Solutions

1. **Stack-based Approach:**

   - Build processed strings using a stack
   - Compare the final processed strings
   - Time: O(n + m), Space: O(n + m)

2. **Brute Force:**
   - Simulate backspace by building new strings
   - Compare the final strings
   - Less efficient, more readable for beginners

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the solution or discuss the problem-solving strategy in more depth?

Let's dive deeper into the problem-solving strategy for this problem, breaking down the thought process and the cognitive tools we use to approach such challenges.

### Cognitive Problem-Solving Framework

#### 1. Problem Decomposition

When first encountering the "Backspace String Compare" problem, the key is to break it down into its fundamental components:

- What does a backspace (#) actually do?
- How can we efficiently process the string?
- What are the key comparison points?

#### 2. Pattern Recognition

The problem hints at several important algorithmic patterns:

- **Reverse Processing**: By working backwards, we simplify the backspace logic
- **Two-Pointer Technique**: Allows simultaneous traversal of both strings
- **Efficient Skipping**: Need a mechanism to handle multiple consecutive backspaces

### Deep Dive into the Solution Strategy

#### Core Challenges

1. **Backspace Simulation**

   - A simple forward pass becomes complicated due to backspaces
   - Naive approach would require rebuilding entire strings

2. **Comparison Complexity**
   - Need to compare final processed strings
   - Want to do this without actually storing processed strings

#### Cognitive Problem-Solving Steps

1. **Initial Insight: Reverse Traversal**

   ```javascript
   // Why start from the end?
   // - Backspaces are easier to handle in reverse
   // - No need to modify original string
   // - Can process characters as we go
   ```

2. **Backspace Handling Mechanism**

   ```javascript
   // Key logic in getNextValidChar function
   const getNextValidChar = (str, index) => {
     let backspaceCount = 0;

     // Mental model:
     // - Encounter '#'? Increment backspace counter
     // - Have backspaces left? Skip characters
     // - No backspaces? Stop and return current character
   };
   ```

#### Algorithmic Thinking Patterns

1. **State Tracking**

   - Use `backspaceCount` as a state variable
   - Dynamically adjust traversal based on this count
   - Demonstrates adaptive algorithm design

2. **Symmetrical Processing**

   ```javascript
   // Notice how we process both strings identically
   // - Same method for both inputs
   // - Generalizable approach
   ```

### Psychological Problem-Solving Techniques

#### 1. Visualization

Imagine the string processing as a "deletion game":

- Start at the end
- Each '#' is a "delete" move
- Try to reach a final state for comparison

#### 2. Incremental Complexity Management

- Start with simple cases (no backspaces)
- Add complexity (single backspace)
- Handle edge cases (multiple consecutive backspaces)

### Advanced Thinking Techniques

#### Invariant Maintenance

- Maintain an invariant: "We always have the next comparable character"
- Each iteration preserves this property
- Ensures algorithm correctness

#### Cognitive Load Reduction

- `getNextValidChar` encapsulates complex logic
- Separates concerns: finding valid characters vs. comparing them
- Makes code more readable and maintainable
