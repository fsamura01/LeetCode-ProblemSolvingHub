# **1385. Find the Distance Value Between Two Arrays**

## **üîç Problem Understanding**

We are given two integer arrays, `arr1` and `arr2`, along with an integer `d`. Our task is to find the **distance value** between these two arrays, which is defined as the count of elements in `arr1` such that there is no element in `arr2` within a distance of `d`.  
Mathematically, an element `x` in `arr1` contributes to the distance value if:  
\[
\forall y \in arr2, |x - y| > d
\]

### **Constraints & Edge Cases**

- `1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 500`
- `-1000 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 1000`
- `0 <= d <= 100`
- Edge cases:
  - When `arr2` is empty ‚Üí All elements of `arr1` contribute to the distance value.
  - When `d = 0` ‚Üí The condition becomes `x ‚â† y`.
  - Large negative or positive values in `arr1` and `arr2` should be considered.

---

### **üßê Pattern Identification**

This problem can be approached in different ways:

1. **Brute Force (Nested Loops)** - Check each element in `arr1` against all elements in `arr2`. Runs in **O(N √ó M)** time.
2. **Binary Search** - Sort `arr2` and for each element in `arr1`, use **binary search** to find the closest element in `arr2`. Runs in **O(N log M)** time.
3. **Two Pointers** - If both arrays are sorted, a two-pointer approach can determine if an element in `arr1` violates the condition efficiently. Runs in **O(N log N + M log M)** due to sorting.

Since sorting allows for an efficient lookup, **Binary Search is an optimal choice**.

---

### **üí° Approach Discussion (Binary Search)**

1. **Sort `arr2`**: This allows us to efficiently search for close elements.
2. **For each element `x` in `arr1`**:
   - Use **binary search** to find the nearest element in `arr2`.
   - Check if `|x - closest_y| > d`.
   - If true, count `x` as a valid element.
3. **Return the count** of such valid elements.

---

### **üìù Code Implementation (JavaScript)**

```javascript
function findTheDistanceValue(arr1, arr2, d) {
  // Step 1: Sort arr2 to enable binary search
  arr2.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  let count = 0;

  // Helper function to perform binary search
  function isValid(x) {
    let left = 0,
      right = arr2.length - 1;

    while (left <= right) {
      let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
      if (Math.abs(arr2[mid] - x) <= d) {
        return false; // Found a violating element
      } else if (arr2[mid] < x) {
        left = mid + 1;
      } else {
        right = mid - 1;
      }
    }

    return true; // No violations found
  }

  // Step 2: Check each element in arr1
  for (let x of arr1) {
    if (isValid(x)) {
      count++;
    }
  }

  return count;
}
```

### **‚è± Complexity Analysis**

| Approach                       | Time Complexity      | Space Complexity | Explanation                                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Brute Force (Nested Loops)** | O(N √ó M)             | O(1)             | Checking every element in `arr1` against `arr2`.                                         |
| **Binary Search (Optimal)**    | O(N log M)           | O(1)             | Sorting `arr2` in O(M log M), then performing O(log M) binary search for each `arr1[i]`. |
| **Two Pointers**               | O(N log N + M log M) | O(1)             | Sorting both arrays, then scanning linearly.                                             |

Since **N, M ‚â§ 500**, `O(N log M)` is efficient.

### **üîÑ Alternative Approaches**

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Brute Force (Nested Loops)**

```javascript
function findTheDistanceValue(arr1, arr2, d) {
  let count = 0;

  for (let x of arr1) {
    let valid = true;
    for (let y of arr2) {
      if (Math.abs(x - y) <= d) {
        valid = false;
        break;
      }
    }
    if (valid) count++;
  }

  return count;
}
```

üí° **Inefficient for large inputs** but straightforward.

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Two Pointers (If both arrays are sorted)**

```javascript
function findTheDistanceValue(arr1, arr2, d) {
  arr1.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  arr2.sort((a, b) => a - b);

  let count = 0,
    j = 0;

  for (let x of arr1) {
    while (j < arr2.length && arr2[j] < x - d) j++;
    if (j < arr2.length && Math.abs(arr2[j] - x) <= d) continue;
    count++;
  }

  return count;
}
```

üü¢ **Performs well for large arrays**, runs in **O(N log N + M log M)**.

Sure! Let's break down the JavaScript code snippet step by step:

```javascript
while (j < arr2.length && arr2[j] < x - d) j++;
```

### **üìå Explanation**

This line is part of a **two-pointer approach** used to efficiently determine whether an element `x` from `arr1` has any element in `arr2` within a distance `d`.

### **üìù Step-by-Step Breakdown**

1. **`while (j < arr2.length && arr2[j] < x - d)`**

   - This loop runs as long as:
     - `j < arr2.length` ‚Üí Ensures we don't go out of bounds.
     - `arr2[j] < x - d` ‚Üí This checks if `arr2[j]` is **too small** to be relevant for comparison.

2. **`j++`**
   - Moves the pointer `j` forward in `arr2` to find an element **greater than or equal to** `x - d`.

---

### **üîç Why is this check done?**

Since `arr2` is **sorted**, any element `arr2[j] < x - d` is **guaranteed** to be too far from `x`.  
Thus, we can skip those elements and directly move `j` to a potentially useful position.

---

### **üí° Example Walkthrough**

#### **Given Inputs**

```javascript
arr1 = [4, 8];
arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 10, 12];
d = 3;
```

#### **Example: Processing `x = 4`**

1. Initially, `j = 0`, so `arr2[j] = 1`.
2. Since `1 < 4 - 3` (`1 < 1` is `false`), the loop stops immediately.
3. Now, we check if `|arr2[j] - x| > d` (i.e., `|arr2[0] - 4| > 3`).

#### **Example Walkthrough for `x = 8`**

1. Initially, `j = 0`, so `arr2[j] = 1`.
2. Since `1 < 8 - 3` (`1 < 5`), move `j++ ‚Üí 1`.
3. `arr2[1] = 2`, and `2 < 5`, move `j++ ‚Üí 2`.
4. `arr2[2] = 3`, and `3 < 5`, move `j++ ‚Üí 3`.
5. `arr2[3] = 10`, and `10 < 5` is `false`, so we stop.

---

### **‚è≥ Time Complexity**

- The **`while` loop runs in O(N)** **overall**, but since each `j++` moves forward and doesn‚Äôt reset, it results in an **O(N + M) time complexity** for the entire solution.

---

### **üìå Summary of Two Pointers Approach**

- This loop **skips elements in `arr2` that are too small** to be within `d` of `x`.
- It takes advantage of the sorted property of `arr2`, making it more efficient than a brute-force comparison.
- This is an example of an **optimized Two-Pointer Technique**.

### **üîç Understanding `x - d` in JavaScript**

The expression **`x - d`** appears in the context of a two-pointer or binary search approach in the given problem. Let's break it down step by step.

---

### **üìå What Does `x - d` Mean?**

- Here, `x` is an element from `arr1`, and `d` is the given **distance constraint**.
- The expression `x - d` calculates the **lower bound** of values in `arr2` that are too far from `x`.

---

### **üí° Why Use `x - d`?**

- The problem asks us to check if any element in `arr2` is within a distance of `d` from `x`, meaning:

  `|x - y|<= d`

  - This is equivalent to:

    `x - d <= y <= x + d`

- The key idea is:
  - If `arr2[j] < x - d`, then `arr2[j]` is **too small** to ever be within `d` of `x`.
  - Thus, we can safely **skip those elements** in `arr2` using a loop (`while` or binary search).

---

### **üîÑ Step-by-Step Example**

#### **üî¢ Given Inputs**

```javascript
arr1 = [4, 8];
arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 10, 12];
d = 3;
```

#### **Processing `x = 4`**

1. Calculate **`x - d = 4 - 3 = 1`**.
2. `arr2` is sorted, and `arr2[j] = 1`.
3. Since `arr2[j] < x - d` (`1 < 1` is `false`), we **don‚Äôt** skip any elements.

#### **Processing `x = 8`**

1. Calculate **`x - d = 8 - 3 = 5`**.
2. `arr2 = [1, 2, 3, 10, 12]`, and initially `arr2[j] = 1`.
3. Since `1 < 5`, we **skip** `1` (`j++`).
4. Since `2 < 5`, we **skip** `2` (`j++`).
5. Since `3 < 5`, we **skip** `3` (`j++`).
6. Now, `arr2[j] = 10`, and `10 < 5` is **false**, so we **stop** skipping.

---

### **üìå Summary**

- `x - d` helps define a lower bound for skipping unnecessary elements.
- It improves efficiency when searching for values close to `x`.
- It avoids unnecessary comparisons, making the approach **faster**.
