# **1385. Find the Distance Value Between Two Arrays**

I'll help you understand and solve the "Find the Distance Value Between Two Arrays" problem. Let's break it down step by step.

## **Problem Understanding**

Let's first understand what this problem is asking us to do. The problem gives us two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, and a value `d`. We need to find the `"distance value"` between these arrays. A number from arr1 contributes to the distance value if there is no number in arr2 that is within d units of it (meaning the absolute difference is less than or equal to d).

For example, if we have:

```javascript
arr1 = [4, 5, 8];
arr2 = [10, 9, 1, 8];
d = 2;
```

Let's examine what makes a value count:

- For 4: No numbers in arr2 are within 2 units of 4 (closest is 1, but |4-1| = 3 > 2)
- For 5: No numbers in arr2 are within 2 units of 5
- For 8: 8 exists in arr2, so |8-8| = 0 â‰¤ 2

Therefore, the distance value would be 2 (from values 4 and 5).

## **Pattern Identification**

This problem primarily involves array traversal and comparison. While it might look like a two-pointer problem at first glance, the key pattern here is actually array searching. For each element in arr1, we need to check if there exists any element in arr2 that satisfies our condition.

## **Approach Discussion**

Let's develop our solution step by step:

a. For each element in arr1:

- We need to check if there exists any element in arr2 within distance d
- If no such element exists, increment our counter

b. We can optimize this by:

- First sorting arr2 (optional optimization)
- Using binary search to find the closest elements (for optimized solution)

Let's implement both the straightforward and optimized solutions.

## **Code Implementation**

First, let's implement the straightforward solution:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr1
 * @param {number[]} arr2
 * @param {number} d
 * @return {number}
 */
const findTheDistanceValue = (arr1, arr2, d) => {
  // Initialize our distance counter
  let distanceValue = 0;

  // Check each element in arr1
  for (let num1 of arr1) {
    let isValid = true;

    // Compare with each element in arr2
    for (let num2 of arr2) {
      // If we find any number within distance d
      if (Math.abs(num1 - num2) <= d) {
        isValid = false;
        break;
      }
    }

    // If no number in arr2 was within distance d
    if (isValid) {
      distanceValue++;
    }
  }

  return distanceValue;
};
```

Now, let's implement the optimized solution using binary search:

```javascript
const findTheDistanceValue = (arr1, arr2, d) => {
  // Sort arr2 for binary search
  arr2.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  let distanceValue = 0;

  for (let num of arr1) {
    // If no close number found in arr2, increment distance
    if (isValidDistance(arr2, num, d)) {
      distanceValue++;
    }
  }

  return distanceValue;
};

// Helper function to check if any number in arr is within distance d of target
const isValidDistance = (arr, target, d) => {
  let left = 0;
  let right = arr.length - 1;

  while (left <= right) {
    const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

    if (Math.abs(arr[mid] - target) <= d) {
      return false;
    }

    if (arr[mid] < target) {
      left = mid + 1;
    } else {
      right = mid - 1;
    }
  }

  return true;
};
```

## **Complexity Analysis**

Straightforward Solution:

- Time Complexity: O(n \* m) where n is length of arr1 and m is length of arr2
- Space Complexity: O(1)

Optimized Solution:

- Time Complexity: O(m log m + n log m) where m is length of arr2 (sorting + binary search)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

## **Alternative Solutions**

We could also consider using a Set or Map data structure if we're working with a very large arr2 and want to optimize for repeated lookups. However, given the constraint that 1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 500, our current solutions are sufficient.

## **Similar Problems for Practice**

Here are some related problems that use similar patterns:

- "Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted" (LeetCode 167)
- "Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array" (LeetCode 34)
- "Search Insert Position" (LeetCode 35)

Let me create a flowchart to visualize the solution process. I'll use Mermaid for this:

The key insight for this problem is understanding that we're looking for elements in arr1 that maintain a minimum "safe distance" from all elements in arr2. While the brute force approach is straightforward and works well for small arrays, the binary search optimization showcases how we can leverage a sorted array to improve performance.
