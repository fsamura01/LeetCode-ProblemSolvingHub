# **This JavaScript block:**

```javascript
haystack.substring(i, i + needle.length) === needle;
```

is used to check whether the substring of the string `haystack` starting at index `i`
and ending just before `i + needle.length` is equal to the string `needle`.
Here's a step-by-step explanation:

---

## **1. What Does `substring()` Do?**

The `substring(start, end)` method in JavaScript extracts a portion of a string:

- `start`: The index of the first character to include in the substring.
- `end`: The index where the extraction stops (not included in the substring).

For example:

```javascript
const str = "hello";
console.log(str.substring(1, 4)); // Output: "ell"
```

---

### **2. Purpose of `i` and `i + needle.length`**

In the block:

```javascript
haystack.substring(i, i + needle.length);
```

- `i`: The current index in the `haystack` string where we start extracting a substring.
- `i + needle.length`: The index where the substring ends, which ensures the length of
  the extracted substring matches the length of `needle`.

For instance, if:

- `haystack = "hello"`, `needle = "ell"`, and `i = 1`:
  - `haystack.substring(i, i + needle.length)` → `haystack.substring(1, 4)` → `"ell"`.

---

### **3. Comparing Substrings with `===`**

The code then compares the extracted substring with the `needle`
string using the strict equality operator (`===`). This ensures that:

1. The two strings have the same content.
2. The comparison is case-sensitive.

Example:

```javascript
const haystack = "hello";
const needle = "ell";
console.log(haystack.substring(1, 4) === needle); // Output: true
```

---

### **4. Use Case in a Sliding Window**

This block of code is commonly used in a sliding window technique to find a substring in a string. Here's how it works:

- Iterate through `haystack` using a sliding window of size `needle.length`.
- At each step (`i`), extract the substring using `substring(i, i + needle.length)` and compare it to `needle`.
- If the two are equal, you’ve found the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`.

---

### **Step-by-Step Example**

Given:

```javascript
const haystack = "sadbutsad";
const needle = "sad";
```

1. **First Iteration (`i = 0`)**:

   - Extract substring: `haystack.substring(0, 3) = "sad"`.
   - Compare with `needle`: `"sad" === "sad"` → Match found.

2. **Second Iteration (`i = 1`)**:

   - Extract substring: `haystack.substring(1, 4) = "adb"`.
   - Compare with `needle`: `"adb" === "sad"` → No match.

3. **Continue Sliding**:
   - For `i = 6`, extract substring: `haystack.substring(6, 9) = "sad"`.
   - Compare with `needle`: `"sad" === "sad"` → Match found.

---

### **In Summary**

The block:

```javascript
haystack.substring(i, i + needle.length) === needle;
```

1. Extracts a substring from `haystack` starting at index `i` with the same length as `needle`.
2. Compares this substring to `needle` to check for equality.
3. Is typically used in a loop to locate the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`.

Your function `strStr` implements a basic substring search algorithm to find the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`. Here's a quick analysis and review of your implementation:

---

### **Explanation of the Code**

1. **Edge Case Handling**:

   ```javascript
   if (needle === " " || needle.length > haystack.length) {
     return -1;
   }
   ```

   - This checks two conditions:
     - If `needle` is `" "` (an empty string), which isn't correct since `" "` (space) isn't necessarily equivalent to an empty string `""`.
     - If `needle` is longer than `haystack`, return `-1` since it's impossible for `needle` to be found in `haystack`.

   **Fix Suggestion**: The correct condition should check if `needle` is an empty string (`""`):

   ```javascript
   if (needle === "") {
     return 0; // According to the problem description, return 0 for empty needle.
   }
   ```

2. **Iterating Through `haystack`**:

   ```javascript
   for (let i = 0; i <= haystack.length - needle.length; i++) {
     if (haystack.substring(i, i + needle.length) === needle) {
       return i;
     }
   }
   ```

   - You iterate through `haystack` up to `haystack.length - needle.length`, which is correct because beyond this range, `needle` cannot fit in `haystack`.
   - For each position `i`, you extract a substring of the same length as `needle` using `haystack.substring(i, i + needle.length)` and check if it matches `needle`.

3. **Return -1**:

   ```javascript
   return -1;
   ```

   - If no match is found, return `-1` as expected.

---

### **Edge Cases**

- `haystack = ""`, `needle = ""` → Should return `0`.
- `haystack = ""`, `needle = "a"` → Should return `-1`.
- `haystack = "hello"`, `needle = ""` → Should return `0`.
- `haystack = "hello"`, `needle = "o"` → Should return `4`.
- `haystack = "aaaaa"`, `needle = "bba"` → Should return `-1`.

---

### **Time and Space Complexity**

1. **Time Complexity**:

   - The outer loop iterates over `haystack` up to `haystack.length - needle.length`.
   - For each iteration, `substring` takes `O(needle.length)` time to create a substring.
   - Overall, the time complexity is **O((n - m) \* m)**, where `n` is the length of `haystack` and `m` is the length of `needle`.

   In the worst case (when `needle` is much shorter than `haystack`), this can approach **O(n \* m)**.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - Each call to `substring` creates a new string, so the space complexity is **O(m)** per iteration, leading to **O(m)** overall in terms of auxiliary space.

---

### **Optimized Approach**

You can optimize this to **O(n + m)** using the **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm**. KMP preprocesses the `needle` to create a "partial match" table that reduces redundant comparisons during the search.

This condition, `haystack.length - needle.length`, is used to determine how far we need to iterate through the `haystack` to check for the presence of the `needle`. Let me explain it step-by-step:

---

### **Why Use `haystack.length - needle.length`?**

1. **Goal of the Loop**:

   - You are looking for the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`.
   - To do so, you iterate through the `haystack` and check substrings of length equal to the `needle`.

2. **Length Difference**:

   - If `needle` is of length `m` and `haystack` is of length `n`, the last possible starting position for a substring in `haystack` that is as long as `needle` is at index `n - m`.
   - Beyond this point, there aren’t enough characters left in `haystack` to match the length of `needle`.

3. **Example Walkthrough**:

   - Suppose `haystack = "hello"` and `needle = "ll"`.

     - The length of `haystack` (`n`) is 5.
     - The length of `needle` (`m`) is 2.
     - The last possible starting index in `haystack` to match `needle` is `5 - 2 = 3`.
     - Index `3` is where the substring `"lo"` starts, which is the last substring to check.

   - The loop condition `i <= haystack.length - needle.length` ensures you stop iterating after checking all valid substrings.

---

### **Loop in Context**

Here’s the loop in your code:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i <= haystack.length - needle.length; i++) {
  if (haystack.substring(i, i + needle.length) === needle) {
    return i;
  }
}
```

- **Initialization**: Start `i` at `0` (the beginning of `haystack`).
- **End Condition**: Stop at `haystack.length - needle.length` because beyond this, substrings of length `needle.length` are not possible.

---

### **Edge Case**

If `needle.length > haystack.length`, then:

- `haystack.length - needle.length` will be negative.
- The loop condition `i <= haystack.length - needle.length` will fail immediately, and the loop won’t execute.
- This correctly ensures that the function returns `-1` in such cases.

---

### **In Summary\_**

The condition `haystack.length - needle.length`:

1. Ensures the loop only checks valid starting indices in `haystack` where `needle` could fit.
2. Prevents unnecessary iterations beyond the range where a match is possible.

Let me know if you'd like further clarification!

The reason why "there aren’t enough characters left in `haystack` to match the length of `needle`" is because a substring of a specific length (in this case, the length of `needle`) requires a starting position in `haystack` such that there are still sufficient characters remaining in the string.

Let me break this down with an example:

---

### **Key Idea: Matching Substring Length**

When you look for `needle` in `haystack`, you're comparing `needle` with substrings of the same length from `haystack`. For example:

- If `needle` has 3 characters, you can only extract substrings of length 3 from `haystack` for comparison.

### **Stopping Condition: `haystack.length - needle.length`**

If `needle` has `m` characters and `haystack` has `n` characters:

- The starting index `i` of the last valid substring of length `m` in `haystack` is `n - m`.
- Beyond this index, there aren’t enough characters left in `haystack` to create a substring of length `m`.

---

### **Example 1: Short Strings**

**`haystack = "hello"` (length 5)**  
**`needle = "ll"` (length 2)**

1. Possible substrings of length 2:

   - `"he"` (start at index 0)
   - `"el"` (start at index 1)
   - `"ll"` (start at index 2)
   - `"lo"` (start at index 3)

2. Once the starting index reaches **3**, the substring is `"lo"`.  
   **At index 4**, there are not enough characters left to create a substring of length 2.  
   That’s why the loop stops at `i = haystack.length - needle.length` (i.e., `5 - 2 = 3`).

---

### **Example 2: Edge Case**

**`haystack = "a"` (length 1)**  
**`needle = "abc"` (length 3)**

1. `needle.length > haystack.length` means `1 - 3 = -2`.
2. The loop condition `i <= haystack.length - needle.length` becomes `i <= -2`.
3. The loop won’t even start, as `i` cannot be less than or equal to `-2`.

---

### **Why Stop Beyond `n - m`?**

- A substring of length `m` starting at index `i` requires the range `[i, i + m)` to exist within `haystack`.
- If `i + m > n`, this range goes beyond the end of `haystack`, so no valid substring can be formed.
- Stopping at `haystack.length - needle.length` ensures you only check valid substrings.

---

In essence, the condition ensures the function doesn't try to extract a substring that exceeds the length of `haystack`, which would cause errors or unnecessary checks. Let me know if this clarifies it for you!

Let’s clarify using the string `haystack = "sadbutsad"` and `needle = "sad"`. The task is to find the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`.

---

### **Key Details:**

- `haystack` length = 9
- `needle` length = 3
- The last valid starting position for a substring of length 3 in `haystack` is at index:  
  **`haystack.length - needle.length = 9 - 3 = 6`**.

This means the loop will iterate through indices `0` to `6`.

---

### **Step-by-Step Explanation:**

#### **Iteration 1** (`i = 0`):\*\*

- Extract substring: `haystack.substring(0, 0 + 3) = "sad"`.
- Compare: `"sad" === "sad"` → **True**.
- Return the index `0` as the first occurrence of `needle`.

---

### **Why Stop at `i = 6`?**

If the loop condition is `i <= haystack.length - needle.length` (i.e., `i <= 6`), we stop after index `6`. Here’s why:

#### For **`i = 6`:**

- Extract substring: `haystack.substring(6, 6 + 3) = "sad"`.
- Compare: `"sad" === "sad"` → **True**.

#### For **`i = 7`:**

- If you tried `haystack.substring(7, 7 + 3)`, this would attempt to extract `"ad"` (index 7 to 10), which goes **out of bounds** since `haystack` only has indices from `0` to `8`.

Thus, the loop stops at `i = 6` to avoid accessing indices beyond the length of `haystack`.

---

### **Complete Execution of the Loop**

For clarity, here’s what happens in each iteration when `haystack = "sadbutsad"` and `needle = "sad"`:

| `i` | Substring (`haystack.substring(i, i + needle.length)`) | Comparison with `"sad"` |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| `0` | `"sad"`                                                | Match (Return `0`)      |

---

### **Conclusion**

- The substring search stops at `haystack.length - needle.length` because beyond that, extracting substrings of length `needle` would exceed the bounds of `haystack`.
- In this example, the loop correctly finds the first occurrence of `"sad"` at index `0` and returns it.
