# **Flowchart workthrough**

## Let me walk you through this flowchart that illustrates the solution to the "Reverse Only Letters" problem. Think of it as a road map for our algorithm's journey through the string

The process begins at "Start" and follows a logical sequence:

First, we convert the input string to an array (B). This is necessary in JavaScript because strings are immutable, meaning we can't modify them directly. It's like converting a printed page into loose letters that we can rearrange.

Next, we set up our two pointers (C): 'left' starts at the beginning (index 0), and 'right' starts at the end (length-1). Imagine these as two people walking toward each other from opposite ends of the string.

The main loop (D) checks if the left pointer is still less than the right pointer. This is crucial because when they meet or cross, we've processed all characters we need to consider. Think of it as making sure our two people haven't passed each other yet.

Now comes the interesting part. For each iteration:

1. We first check if the left pointer is pointing to a letter (E). If it's not (like if it's pointing to a hyphen or number), we move the left pointer one step right (F) and go back to check the condition again. It's like our left person skipping over any non-letter obstacles they encounter.

2. If the left pointer is at a letter, we then check if the right pointer is at a letter (G). If it's not, we move the right pointer one step left (H) and return to check the condition. Similarly, our right person is skipping over non-letter obstacles from their end.

3. When both pointers are at letters (I), we swap these letters (like our two people exchanging items), then move both pointers toward each other (J) - the left pointer moves right, and the right pointer moves left.

This process continues until the pointers meet or cross (D becomes "No"). At this point, we've processed all the characters we need to consider.

Finally, we convert our array back into a string (K), as if reassembling our loose letters back into a page, and return this result (L).

The beauty of this flowchart is how it visualizes the algorithm's decision-making process. Each diamond shape represents a decision point where the algorithm must choose between different paths based on specific conditions. The arrows show the flow of execution, with some forming loops when we need to repeat certain steps.

For example, if we apply this to the string "ab-cd":

1. Start with ['a','b','-','c','d']
2. Left points to 'a', right to 'd' → swap → ['d','b','-','c','a']
3. Left points to 'b', right to 'c' → swap → ['d','c','-','b','a']
4. Result: "dc-ba"

Would you like to see how this process plays out with a different example string? Or shall we explore any specific part of the flowchart in more detail?
