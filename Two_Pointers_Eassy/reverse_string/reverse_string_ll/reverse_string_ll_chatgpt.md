# 541. Reverse String II

## **Step-by-Step Solution for Problem 541: Reverse String II**

---

## **Understanding the Pattern Using Constraints**

Given constraints:

- `1>= s.length <=10^4` → The solution must be efficient (O(n) complexity is ideal).
- `1 >= k <= 10^4` → k can be large, meaning we must process substrings in chunks.

## **Observing the Pattern**

- The string is processed in **chunks of 2k**.
- In each chunk:
  - Reverse the **first k characters**.
  - Leave the remaining characters (k to 2k) as they are.

### **Breaking Down Example Cases**

#### **Example 1:**

```plaintext
s = "abcdefg", k = 2
```

Chunking into groups of `2k = 4`:

1. `"abcd"` → Reverse first `2` → `"bacd"`
2. `"efg"` → Reverse first `2` → `"feg"`

Final result: **"bacdfeg"**

#### Example 2

```plaintext
s = "abcd", k = 2
```

Chunking into `2k = 4`:

1. `"abcd"` → Reverse first `2` → `"bacd"`

Final result: **"bacd"**

---

### **Efficient JavaScript Solution**

To implement this efficiently, we iterate through the string in steps of `2k` and reverse only the first `k` characters of each chunk.

```javascript
function reverseStr(s, k) {
  let arr = s.split(""); // Convert string to array for easy modification
  let n = s.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i += 2 * k) {
    let left = i;
    let right = Math.min(i + k - 1, n - 1); // Reverse only the first k in the 2k chunk

    // Reverse the substring in place
    while (left < right) {
      [arr[left], arr[right]] = [arr[right], arr[left]];
      left++;
      right--;
    }
  }

  return arr.join(""); // Convert back to string
}
```

---

### **Complexity Analysis**

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - We traverse the string once in chunks of `2k`, modifying `k` characters each time → Linear scan.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - The `split()` and `join()` operations take extra space, but in-place reversal minimizes additional usage.

---

### **Final Thoughts**

- The key was recognizing the **2k chunk pattern**.
- We optimized by reversing only the necessary parts using **two-pointer swapping**.
- This runs efficiently within the given constraints.

## **Why Does This Approach Work?**

The approach works because it **leverages the pattern** given in the problem constraints. Let's break it down systematically.

---

## **1️⃣ Recognizing the Structure of the Problem**

- We are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.
- We need to process the string in **chunks of `2k`**.
- Within each chunk of `2k`:
  1. **Reverse the first `k` characters.**
  2. **Keep the rest (`k` to `2k`) unchanged.**
- If the remaining part of the string is **less than `k`**, reverse all of it.

---

## **2️⃣ Spotting the Key Pattern**

Given `s = "abcdefg"` and `k = 2`, let's group into chunks of `2k = 4`:

| Index Range | Original String | Reverse First `k` | Resulting String |
| ----------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- |
| `0 to 3`    | `"abcd"`        | `"bacd"`          | `"bacd"`         |
| `4 to 6`    | `"efg"`         | `"feg"`           | `"feg"`          |

Final output: **"bacdfeg"**

This pattern holds for all cases, ensuring correctness.

---

## **3️⃣ Why Is This Approach Correct?**

This method works because:

1. **It ensures every `2k` block follows the problem's rule**
   - It processes `s` in steps of `2k`, ensuring each part gets handled exactly once.
2. **The two-pointer reversal efficiently swaps only the necessary parts**
   - Instead of creating new substrings, we swap characters in place.
3. **Handles edge cases gracefully**
   - If there are fewer than `k` characters left → **reverse all**.
   - If there are `k ≤ remaining < 2k` → **only reverse the first `k` characters**.

---

## **4️⃣ Why Is This Approach Efficient?**

- **Time Complexity: O(n)**
  - Each character is swapped at most once in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity: O(n) (due to array conversion) but O(1) extra space**
  - The array conversion (`split()`) takes space, but no extra data structures are used.

---

### **✅ Summary**

This approach works because:

1. **It correctly follows the given rules in every `2k` block.**
2. **It uses an efficient in-place reversal, minimizing extra computations.**
3. **It handles edge cases naturally without additional checks.**

## **Key Insight That Simplifies the Problem**

The **crucial insight** is recognizing that the string is processed in **fixed, non-overlapping chunks of `2k`**.

By **breaking the problem into independent chunks**, we can treat each **`2k` segment as an isolated unit** and apply a simple transformation:

1. **Reverse the first `k` characters in each `2k` chunk**.
2. **Leave the remaining `k` characters unchanged**.

---

## **Why This Insight Simplifies the Problem**

🔹 **No need for nested loops or extra tracking**

- Instead of complex logic to track how many characters have been reversed, we simply move in steps of `2k` and apply the transformation locally.

🔹 **Each `2k` chunk is independent**

- Instead of thinking about the entire string at once, we **only focus on the next `2k` characters at a time**.
- This makes the problem easier to implement without recursion or backtracking.

🔹 **Reduces to a simple two-pointer swap**

- Since only the first `k` characters are reversed within each chunk, we can efficiently reverse them using a two-pointer approach, which runs in **O(k) time per chunk**.

---

### **Example Breakdown Using This Insight**

Given `s = "abcdefg"` and `k = 2`, chunk it into `2k = 4` blocks:

1. `"abcd"` → Reverse first `2` → `"bacd"`
2. `"efg"` → Reverse first `2` → `"feg"`

Final result: `"bacdfeg"`

👉 Instead of treating this as a complex problem, we see it as **applying a local operation to independent `2k` chunks**.

---

### **How This Insight Guides the Solution**

This **localized, chunk-based** thinking allows us to:

- **Avoid unnecessary computations** (no need to check each character one by one).
- **Use a simple iteration pattern** (looping in increments of `2k`).
- **Achieve O(n) efficiency** by ensuring each character is processed once.

🚀 **Big takeaway:** Instead of treating the string as a whole, **process it in independent `2k` segments**, reducing complexity and making the problem trivial!

## **Applying This Approach to Similar Problems**

The **key idea** behind this problem—**processing a string in independent fixed-size chunks and applying localized transformations**—can be **generalized** to solve other problems efficiently.

Here’s how you can **apply this approach** to similar problems:

---

### **🔹 Step 1: Identify a Repeating Chunk Pattern**

Look for problems where:

- The string (or array) is **processed in fixed-size segments**.
- Each segment follows a simple transformation rule.
- The operation is **localized**, meaning you don’t need to track the entire string at once.

👉 **Example Variations**:

- **Reverse every `k` characters but skip the next `k`** → _(This problem: Leetcode 541)_
- **Uppercase the first `k` characters in every `2k` segment** → _Simple modification_
- **Sort every `k` characters in increasing order** → _Use sorting instead of reversal_
- **Alternate between reversing and leaving the next segment unchanged** → _Use flags to toggle operations_

---

### **🔹 Step 2: Implement a `for` Loop That Steps in Fixed Intervals**

Instead of handling elements **one-by-one**, process them in **chunks of `2k` (or some interval)**.

👉 **Generalized Loop Structure**:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < n; i += 2 * k) {
  // Process the first k elements of this chunk
  let left = i;
  let right = Math.min(i + k - 1, n - 1);

  // Apply the operation (reverse, transform, etc.)
  while (left < right) {
    [arr[left], arr[right]] = [arr[right], arr[left]];
    left++;
    right--;
  }
}
```

- This ensures **O(n) complexity** because each element is visited once.

---

### **🔹 Step 3: Modify the Transformation for Different Problems**

Once the pattern is set, you can **swap out the transformation logic** for different variations.

👉 **Example 1: Convert Every First `k` Characters to Uppercase**

```javascript
function uppercaseStr(s, k) {
  let arr = s.split("");
  let n = s.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i += 2 * k) {
    for (let j = i; j < Math.min(i + k, n); j++) {
      arr[j] = arr[j].toUpperCase();
    }
  }

  return arr.join("");
}
```

✅ **Same chunk-based approach, different transformation.**

---

👉 **Example 2: Sort Every `k` Characters**

```javascript
function sortChunks(s, k) {
  let arr = s.split("");
  let n = s.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < n; i += 2 * k) {
    let subArr = arr.slice(i, Math.min(i + k, n)).sort(); // Sort first k chars
    for (let j = 0; j < subArr.length; j++) {
      arr[i + j] = subArr[j]; // Replace in original array
    }
  }

  return arr.join("");
}
```

✅ **Only modifies `k` characters at a time while keeping the overall structure.**

---

### **🔹 Step 4: Handle Edge Cases Gracefully**

Since we process **`k` characters per chunk**, we always check:

- **If fewer than `k` characters remain** → Process all of them.
- **If between `k` and `2k` remain** → Only modify the first `k` characters.

Using:

```javascript
Math.min(i + k - 1, n - 1);
```

ensures we never go out of bounds.

---

### **🎯 Final Takeaways**

✔ **Spot the fixed-size chunking pattern.**  
✔ **Use a `for` loop with steps of `2k`.**  
✔ **Apply the required transformation inside each chunk.**  
✔ **Adapt the transformation logic for different problems.**

By recognizing this pattern, you can solve **many string and array transformation problems efficiently** in **O(n) time**! 🚀

## **Why Does `right` Point to `Math.min(i + k - 1, n - 1)`?**

The expression

```javascript
let right = Math.min(i + k - 1, n - 1);
```

ensures that **we don’t go out of bounds** when selecting the rightmost character to reverse in a segment.

---

### **🔹 Breaking It Down**

#### **1️⃣ What Does `i + k - 1` Represent?**

- `i` is the starting index of the current `2k` chunk.
- We want to reverse the **first `k` characters** in this chunk.
- `i + k - 1` calculates the **index of the last character in this `k`-segment**.

👉 Example:

```plaintext
s = "abcdefg", k = 2

Chunk 1: "abcd" (first `2k` group)
- i = 0 (start of chunk)
- i + k - 1 = 0 + 2 - 1 = 1 (index 1, last char in first `k` segment)
```

✅ Expected reversal: `"ba"cd`

---

#### **2️⃣ Why Use `Math.min(i + k - 1, n - 1)`?**

- If `i + k - 1` exceeds the string’s length (`n - 1`), we **must not go out of bounds**.
- We use `Math.min(...)` to **limit `right` to the last valid index** (`n - 1`).

👉 Example:

```plaintext
s = "abcd", k = 3

Chunk 1: "abcd"
- i = 0 (start of chunk)
- i + k - 1 = 0 + 3 - 1 = 2 (index 2)

No issue here since `2 < n - 1 (3)`, so we reverse `"abc" → "cba"`
```

👉 Edge Case: Small String

```plaintext
s = "abc", k = 4

Chunk 1: "abc"
- i = 0
- i + k - 1 = 0 + 4 - 1 = 3 ❌ (out of bounds, since `n - 1 = 2`)

Math.min(3, 2) → `right = 2`, so we safely reverse `"abc" → "cba"`
```

✅ **Prevents accessing out-of-bounds indexes**.

---

### **🔹 Final Conclusion**

The use of:

```javascript
let right = Math.min(i + k - 1, n - 1);
```

- Ensures the **right pointer stays within the valid range**.
- **Handles cases where fewer than `k` characters remain**.
- **Prevents array index errors and ensures correct reversals**.

🚀 **This simple check keeps the solution efficient and safe!**
