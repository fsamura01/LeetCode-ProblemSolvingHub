# **2460. Apply Operations to an Array**

I'll guide you through solving the LeetCode problem "2460. Apply Operations to an Array" step by step, focusing on problem-solving strategies and algorithmic thinking.

## Problem Understanding

Let's break down the problem statement:

- You are given an array of integers
- You need to apply a specific set of operations to the array
- The operations involve modifying the array in a particular way

**Problem Statement Breakdown:**

1. Input: An integer array
2. Operations:
   - Scan the array from left to right
   - When two consecutive elements are equal, merge them
   - Merging means:
     - Multiply the current element by 2
     - Set the next element to 0
3. After performing all operations, shift all zeros to the end of the array
4. Return the modified array

**Constraints to Consider:**

- Array length can vary
- Elements can be positive integers
- Zero is a valid element
- In-place modification might be required

## Pattern Identification

**Algorithmic Pattern:** Simulation with Two-Pass Approach

- First pass: Perform merging operations
- Second pass: Shift non-zero elements
- Requires careful index manipulation

## Approach Discussion

Let's break down the solution into clear steps:

1. **Merging Phase:**
   - Iterate through the array from left to right
   - Check if current and next elements are equal
   - If equal, double the current element
   - Set the next element to zero
   - Skip the next index to avoid double-merging

2. **Shifting Phase:**
   - Create a new array to store non-zero elements
   - Iterate through the original array
   - Collect all non-zero elements in order
   - Pad the end with zeros to maintain original length

## **Code Implementation**

I'll create an artifact with the JavaScript implementation:

## **Complexity Analysis**

**Time Complexity:** O(n)

- First pass (merging): O(n)
- Second pass (shifting): O(n)
- Total: O(n)

**Space Complexity:** O(n)

- We create a new array to store the result
- Space used is proportional to input array length

## **Alternative Solutions**

1. **In-Place Modification:**
   - Instead of creating a new array, modify the original array in-place
   - Requires two-pointer technique
   - Slightly more memory-efficient

2. **Single-Pass Approach:**
   - Combine merging and shifting in a single pass
   - More complex implementation
   - Potential optimization for larger arrays

## **Practice Recommendations**

2. 26 - Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
3. 283 - Move Zeroes
4. 1460 - Make Two Arrays Equal by Reversing Subarrays

## **Flowchart**

I'll create a flowchart to visualize the solution:

## **Key Learning Points**

1. **Problem-Solving Strategy:**
   - Break complex array manipulation into distinct phases
   - First transform the array
   - Then reorganize elements

2. **Algorithmic Thinking:**
   - Recognize patterns of element transformation
   - Design step-by-step solutions
   - Consider time and space trade-offs

3. **Common Interview Patterns:**
   - Array manipulation
   - In-place modifications
   - Two-pass algorithms

**Reflection Questions:**

- How would you optimize this solution for very large arrays?
- Can you think of alternative ways to implement the merging logic?
- What edge cases should you consider in array transformation problems?

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of the solution or discuss the problem-solving approach in more depth?
